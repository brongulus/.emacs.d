2 Foreword
**********

It wasn't always so clear, but the Rust programming language is
fundamentally about ‘empowerment’: no matter what kind of code you are
writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with
confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.

Take, for example, “systems-level” work that deals with low-level
details of memory management, data representation, and concurrency.
Traditionally, this realm of programming is seen as arcane, accessible
only to a select few who have devoted the necessary years learning to
avoid its infamous pitfalls.  And even those who practice it do so with
caution, lest their code be open to exploits, crashes, or corruption.

Rust breaks down these barriers by eliminating the old pitfalls and
providing a friendly, polished set of tools to help you along the way.
Programmers who need to “dip down” into lower-level control can do so
with Rust, without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security
holes, and without having to learn the fine points of a fickle
toolchain.  Better yet, the language is designed to guide you naturally
towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed and memory
usage.

Programmers who are already working with low-level code can use Rust to
raise their ambitions.  For example, introducing parallelism in Rust is
a relatively low-risk operation: the compiler will catch the classical
mistakes for you.  And you can tackle more aggressive optimizations in
your code with the confidence that you won't accidentally introduce
crashes or vulnerabilities.

But Rust isn't limited to low-level systems programming.  It's
expressive and ergonomic enough to make CLI apps, web servers, and many
other kinds of code quite pleasant to write -- you'll find simple
examples of both later in the book.  Working with Rust allows you to
build skills that transfer from one domain to another; you can learn
Rust by writing a web app, then apply those same skills to target your
Raspberry Pi.

This book fully embraces the potential of Rust to empower its users.
It's a friendly and approachable text intended to help you level up not
just your knowledge of Rust, but also your reach and confidence as a
programmer in general.  So dive in, get ready to learn--and welcome to
the Rust community!

3 Introduction
**************

Note: This edition of the book is the same as The Rust Programming
Language (https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition)
available in print and ebook format from No Starch Press
(https://nostarch.com/).

Welcome to ‘The Rust Programming Language’, an introductory book about
Rust.  The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more
reliable software.  High-level ergonomics and low-level control are
often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that
conflict.  Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great
developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level
details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally
associated with such control.

3.1 Who Rust Is For
===================

Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons.  Let's look at a
few of the most important groups.

* Menu:

* Teams of Developers::
* Students::
* Companies::
* Open Source Developers::
* People Who Value Speed and Stability::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Teams of Developers,  Next: Students,  Prev: Who Rust Is For,  Up: Who Rust Is For

3.1.1 Teams of Developers
-------------------------

Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large
teams of developers with varying levels of systems programming
knowledge.  Low-level code is prone to various subtle bugs, which in
most other languages can be caught only through extensive testing and
careful code review by experienced developers.  In Rust, the compiler
plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive
bugs, including concurrency bugs.  By working alongside the compiler,
the team can spend their time focusing on the program's logic rather
than chasing down bugs.

Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming
world:

   • Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes
     adding, compiling, and managing dependencies painless and
     consistent across the Rust ecosystem.
   • The Rustfmt formatting tool ensures a consistent coding style
     across developers.
   • The rust-analyzer powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
     integration for code completion and inline error messages.

By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be
productive while writing systems-level code.

3.1.2 Students
--------------

Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about
systems concepts.  Using Rust, many people have learned about topics
like operating systems development.  The community is very welcoming and
happy to answer student questions.  Through efforts such as this book,
the Rust teams want to make systems concepts more accessible to more
people, especially those new to programming.

3.1.3 Companies
---------------

Hundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a
variety of tasks, including command line tools, web services, DevOps
tooling, embedded devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding,
cryptocurrencies, bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things
applications, machine learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web
browser.

3.1.4 Open Source Developers
----------------------------

Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language,
community, developer tools, and libraries.  We'd love to have you
contribute to the Rust language.

3.1.5 People Who Value Speed and Stability
------------------------------------------

Rust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language.  By
speed, we mean both how quickly Rust code can run and the speed at which
Rust lets you write programs.  The Rust compiler's checks ensure
stability through feature additions and refactoring.  This is in
contrast to the brittle legacy code in languages without these checks,
which developers are often afraid to modify.  By striving for zero-cost
abstractions, higher-level features that compile to lower-level code as
fast as code written manually, Rust endeavors to make safe code be fast
code as well.

The Rust language hopes to support many other users as well; those
mentioned here are merely some of the biggest stakeholders.  Overall,
Rust's greatest ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers
have accepted for decades by providing safety ‘and’ productivity, speed
‘and’ ergonomics.  Give Rust a try and see if its choices work for you.

3.2 Who This Book Is For
========================

This book assumes that you've written code in another programming
language but doesn't make any assumptions about which one.  We've tried
to make the material broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of
programming backgrounds.  We don't spend a lot of time talking about
what programming ‘is’ or how to think about it.  If you're entirely new
to programming, you would be better served by reading a book that
specifically provides an introduction to programming.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: How to Use This Book,  Next: Source Code,  Prev: Who This Book Is For,  Up: Introduction

3.3 How to Use This Book
========================

In general, this book assumes that you're reading it in sequence from
front to back.  Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters,
and earlier chapters might not delve into details on a particular topic
but will revisit the topic in a later chapter.

You'll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and
project chapters.  In concept chapters, you'll learn about an aspect of
Rust.  In project chapters, we'll build small programs together,
applying what you've learned so far.  Chapters 2, 12, and 21 are project
chapters; the rest are concept chapters.

Chapter 1 explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!”
program, and how to use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool.
Chapter 2 is a hands-on introduction to writing a program in Rust,
having you build up a number guessing game.  Here we cover concepts at a
high level, and later chapters will provide additional detail.  If you
want to get your hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is the place for
that.  Chapter 3 covers Rust features that are similar to those of other
programming languages, and in Chapter 4 you'll learn about Rust's
ownership system.  If you're a particularly meticulous learner who
prefers to learn every detail before moving on to the next, you might
want to skip Chapter 2 and go straight to Chapter 3, returning to
Chapter 2 when you'd like to work on a project applying the details
you've learned.

Chapter 5 discusses structs and methods, and Chapter 6 covers enums,
‘match’ expressions, and the ‘if let’ control flow construct.  You'll
use structs and enums to make custom types in Rust.

In Chapter 7, you'll learn about Rust's module system and about privacy
rules for organizing your code and its public Application Programming
Interface (API). Chapter 8 discusses some common collection data
structures that the standard library provides, such as vectors, strings,
and hash maps.  Chapter 9 explores Rust's error-handling philosophy and
techniques.

Chapter 10 digs into generics, traits, and lifetimes, which give you the
power to define code that applies to multiple types.  Chapter 11 is all
about testing, which even with Rust's safety guarantees is necessary to
ensure your program's logic is correct.  In Chapter 12, we'll build our
own implementation of a subset of functionality from the ‘grep’ command
line tool that searches for text within files.  For this, we'll use many
of the concepts we discussed in the previous chapters.

Chapter 13 explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come
from functional programming languages.  In Chapter 14, we'll examine
Cargo in more depth and talk about best practices for sharing your
libraries with others.  Chapter 15 discusses smart pointers that the
standard library provides and the traits that enable their
functionality.

In Chapter 16, we'll walk through different models of concurrent
programming and talk about how Rust helps you to program in multiple
threads fearlessly.  In Chapter 17, we will build on that by exploring
Rust's async and await syntax and the lightweight concurrency model they
support.

Chapter 18 looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented
programming principles you might be familiar with.

Chapter 19 is a reference on patterns and pattern matching, which are
powerful ways of expressing ideas throughout Rust programs.  Chapter 20
contains a smorgasbord of advanced topics of interest, including unsafe
Rust, macros, and more about lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and
closures.

In Chapter 21, we'll complete a project in which we'll implement a
low-level multithreaded web server!

Finally, some appendices contain useful information about the language
in a more reference-like format.  Appendix A covers Rust's keywords,
Appendix B covers Rust's operators and symbols, Appendix C covers
derivable traits provided by the standard library, Appendix D covers
some useful development tools, and Appendix E explains Rust editions.
In Appendix F, you can find translations of the book, and in Appendix G
we'll cover how Rust is made and what nightly Rust is.

There is no wrong way to read this book: if you want to skip ahead, go
for it!  You might have to jump back to earlier chapters if you
experience any confusion.  But do whatever works for you.

An important part of the process of learning Rust is learning how to
read the error messages the compiler displays: these will guide you
toward working code.  As such, we'll provide many examples that don't
compile along with the error message the compiler will show you in each
situation.  Know that if you enter and run a random example, it may not
compile!  Make sure you read the surrounding text to see whether the
example you're trying to run is meant to error.  Ferris will also help
you distinguish code that isn't meant to work:

Ferris                                             Meaning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code does not compile!
This code panics!
This code does not produce the desired behavior.

In most situations, we'll lead you to the correct version of any code
that doesn't compile.

4 Getting Started
*****************

Let's start your Rust journey!  There's a lot to learn, but every
journey starts somewhere.  In this chapter, we'll discuss:

   • Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
   • Writing a program that prints ‘Hello, world!’
   • Using ‘cargo’, Rust's package manager and build system

* Menu:

* Installation::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Command Line Notation,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Getting Started

4.1 Installation
================

The first step is to install Rust.  We'll download Rust through
‘rustup’, a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated
tools.  You'll need an internet connection for the download.

Note: If you prefer not to use ‘rustup’ for some reason, please see the
Other Rust Installation Methods page
(https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html) for
more options.

The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust
compiler.  Rust's stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in
the book that compile will continue to compile with newer Rust versions.
The output might differ slightly between versions because Rust often
improves error messages and warnings.  In other words, any newer, stable
version of Rust you install using these steps should work as expected
with the content of this book.

4.1.1 Command Line Notation
---------------------------

In this chapter and throughout the book, we'll show some commands used
in the terminal.  Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start
with ‘$’.  You don't need to type the ‘$’ character; it's the command
line prompt shown to indicate the start of each command.  Lines that
don't start with ‘$’ typically show the output of the previous command.
Additionally, PowerShell-specific examples will use ‘>’ rather than ‘$’.

4.1.1.1 Installing ‘rustup’ on Linux or macOS
.............................................

If you're using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following
command:

$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the
‘rustup’ tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust.  You
might be prompted for your password.  If the install is successful, the
following line will appear:

Rust is installed now. Great!

You will also need a ‘linker’, which is a program that Rust uses to join
its compiled outputs into one file.  It is likely you already have one.
If you get linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will
typically include a linker.  A C compiler is also useful because some
common Rust packages depend on C code and will need a C compiler.

On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:

$ xcode-select --install

Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their
distribution's documentation.  For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can
install the ‘build-essential’ package.

4.1.1.2 Installing ‘rustup’ on Windows
......................................

On Windows, go to <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install> and follow
the instructions for installing Rust.  At some point in the
installation, you'll be prompted to install Visual Studio.  This
provides a linker and the native libraries needed to compile programs.
If you need more help with this step, see
<https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html>

The rest of this book uses commands that work in both ‘cmd.exe’ and
PowerShell.  If there are specific differences, we'll explain which to
use.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Troubleshooting,  Next: Updating and Uninstalling,  Prev: Installing rustup on Windows,  Up: Command Line Notation

4.1.1.3 Troubleshooting
.......................

To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and
enter this line:

$ rustc --version

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the
latest stable version that has been released, in the following format:

rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)

If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully!  If
you don't see this information, check that Rust is in your ‘%PATH%’
system variable as follows.

In Windows CMD, use:

> echo %PATH%

In PowerShell, use:

> echo $env:Path

In Linux and macOS, use:

$ echo $PATH

If that's all correct and Rust still isn't working, there are a number
of places you can get help.  Find out how to get in touch with other
Rustaceans (a silly nickname we call ourselves) on the community page
(https://www.rust-lang.org/community).

4.1.1.4 Updating and Uninstalling
.................................

Once Rust is installed via ‘rustup’, updating to a newly released
version is easy.  From your shell, run the following update script:

$ rustup update

To uninstall Rust and ‘rustup’, run the following uninstall script from
your shell:

$ rustup self uninstall


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Local Documentation,  Next: Text Editors and Integrated Development Environments,  Prev: Updating and Uninstalling,  Up: Command Line Notation

4.1.1.5 Local Documentation
...........................

The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation
so that you can read it offline.  Run ‘rustup doc’ to open the local
documentation in your browser.

Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and
you're not sure what it does or how to use it, use the application
programming interface (API) documentation to find out!

4.1.1.6 Text Editors and Integrated Development Environments
............................................................

This book makes no assumptions about what tools you use to author Rust
code.  Just about any text editor will get the job done!  However, many
text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) have
built-in support for Rust.  You can always find a fairly current list of
many editors and IDEs on the tools page
(https://www.rust-lang.org/tools) on the Rust website.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Hello World!,  Next: Hello Cargo!,  Prev: Command Line Notation,  Up: Installation

4.1.2 Hello, World!
-------------------

Now that you've installed Rust, it's time to write your first Rust
program.  It's traditional when learning a new language to write a
little program that prints the text ‘Hello, world!’ to the screen, so
we'll do the same here!

Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line.  Rust
makes no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your
code lives, so if you prefer to use an integrated development
environment (IDE) instead of the command line, feel free to use your
favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the
IDE's documentation for details.  The Rust team has been focusing on
enabling great IDE support via ‘rust-analyzer’.  See *note Appendix D:
Appendix D - Useful Development Tools. for more details.

4.1.2.1 Creating a Project Directory
....................................

You'll start by making a directory to store your Rust code.  It doesn't
matter to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects
in this book, we suggest making a ‘projects’ directory in your home
directory and keeping all your projects there.

Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a ‘projects’
directory and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the
‘projects’ directory.

For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:

$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world

For Windows CMD, enter this:

> mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> mkdir hello_world
> cd hello_world


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Writing and Running a Rust Program,  Next: Anatomy of a Rust Program,  Prev: Creating a Project Directory,  Up: Hello World!

4.1.2.2 Writing and Running a Rust Program
..........................................

Next, make a new source file and call it ‘main.rs’.  Rust files always
end with the ‘.rs’ extension.  If you're using more than one word in
your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them.
For example, use ‘hello_world.rs’ rather than ‘helloworld.rs’.

Now open the ‘main.rs’ file you just created and enter the code in
Listing 1-1.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

Save the file and go back to your terminal window in the
‘~/projects/hello_world’ directory.  On Linux or macOS, enter the
following commands to compile and run the file:

$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!

On Windows, enter the command ‘.\main.exe’ instead of ‘./main’:

> rustc main.rs
> .\main.exe
Hello, world!

Regardless of your operating system, the string ‘Hello, world!’ should
print to the terminal.  If you don't see this output, refer back to the
*note “Troubleshooting”: Troubleshooting. part of the Installation
section for ways to get help.

If ‘Hello, world!’ did print, congratulations!  You've officially
written a Rust program.  That makes you a Rust programmer--welcome!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Anatomy of a Rust Program,  Next: Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps,  Prev: Writing and Running a Rust Program,  Up: Hello World!

4.1.2.3 Anatomy of a Rust Program
.................................

Let's review this “Hello, world!” program in detail.  Here's the first
piece of the puzzle:

fn main() {

}

These lines define a function named ‘main’.  The ‘main’ function is
special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust
program.  Here, the first line declares a function named ‘main’ that has
no parameters and returns nothing.  If there were parameters, they would
go inside the parentheses ‘()’.

The function body is wrapped in ‘{}’.  Rust requires curly brackets
around all function bodies.  It's good style to place the opening curly
bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space
in between.

Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you
can use an automatic formatter tool called ‘rustfmt’ to format your code
in a particular style (more on ‘rustfmt’ in *note Appendix D: Appendix D
- Useful Development Tools.).  The Rust team has included this tool with
the standard Rust distribution, as ‘rustc’ is, so it should already be
installed on your computer!

The body of the ‘main’ function holds the following code:

println!("Hello, world!");

This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to
the screen.  There are four important details to notice here.

First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.

Second, ‘println!’ calls a Rust macro.  If it had called a function
instead, it would be entered as ‘println’ (without the ‘!’).  We'll
discuss Rust macros in more detail in Chapter 20.  For now, you just
need to know that using a ‘!’ means that you're calling a macro instead
of a normal function and that macros don't always follow the same rules
as functions.

Third, you see the ‘"Hello, world!"’ string.  We pass this string as an
argument to ‘println!’, and the string is printed to the screen.

Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon (‘;’), which indicates that
this expression is over and the next one is ready to begin.  Most lines
of Rust code end with a semicolon.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps,  Next: Hello Cargo!,  Prev: Anatomy of a Rust Program,  Up: Hello World!

4.1.2.4 Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps
................................................

You've just run a newly created program, so let's examine each step in
the process.

Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust
compiler by entering the ‘rustc’ command and passing it the name of your
source file, like this:

$ rustc main.rs

If you have a C or C++ background, you'll notice that this is similar to
‘gcc’ or ‘clang’.  After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary
executable.

On Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable
by entering the ‘ls’ command in your shell:

$ ls
main  main.rs

On Linux and macOS, you'll see two files.  With PowerShell on Windows,
you'll see the same three files that you would see using CMD. With CMD
on Windows, you would enter the following:

> dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
main.exe
main.pdb
main.rs

This shows the source code file with the ‘.rs’ extension, the executable
file (‘main.exe’ on Windows, but ‘main’ on all other platforms), and,
when using Windows, a file containing debugging information with the
‘.pdb’ extension.  From here, you run the ‘main’ or ‘main.exe’ file,
like this:

$ ./main # or .\main.exe on Windows

If your ‘main.rs’ is your “Hello, world!” program, this line prints
‘Hello, world!’ to your terminal.

If you're more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python,
or JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program
as separate steps.  Rust is an ‘ahead-of-time compiled’ language,
meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone
else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.  If you
give someone a ‘.rb’, ‘.py’, or ‘.js’ file, they need to have a Ruby,
Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively).  But in
those languages, you only need one command to compile and run your
program.  Everything is a trade-off in language design.

Just compiling with ‘rustc’ is fine for simple programs, but as your
project grows, you'll want to manage all the options and make it easy to
share your code.  Next, we'll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which
will help you write real-world Rust programs.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Hello Cargo!,  Next: Summary,  Prev: Hello World!,  Up: Installation

4.1.3 Hello, Cargo!
-------------------

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.  Most Rustaceans use
this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of
tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries
your code depends on, and building those libraries.  (We call the
libraries that your code needs ‘dependencies’.)

The simplest Rust programs, like the one we've written so far, don't
have any dependencies.  If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with
Cargo, it would only use the part of Cargo that handles building your
code.  As you write more complex Rust programs, you'll add dependencies,
and if you start a project using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much
easier to do.

Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this
book assumes that you're using Cargo too.  Cargo comes installed with
Rust if you used the official installers discussed in the *note
“Installation”: Installation. section.  If you installed Rust through
some other means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the
following in your terminal:

$ cargo --version

If you see a version number, you have it!  If you see an error, such as
‘command not found’, look at the documentation for your method of
installation to determine how to install Cargo separately.

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Creating a Project with Cargo,  Next: Building and Running a Cargo Project,  Prev: Hello Cargo!,  Up: Hello Cargo!

4.1.3.1 Creating a Project with Cargo
.....................................

Let's create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from
our original “Hello, world!” project.  Navigate back to your ‘projects’
directory (or wherever you decided to store your code).  Then, on any
operating system, run the following:

$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo

The first command creates a new directory and project called
‘hello_cargo’.  We've named our project ‘hello_cargo’, and Cargo creates
its files in a directory of the same name.

Go into the ‘hello_cargo’ directory and list the files.  You'll see that
Cargo has generated two files and one directory for us: a ‘Cargo.toml’
file and a ‘src’ directory with a ‘main.rs’ file inside.

It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a ‘.gitignore’
file.  Git files won't be generated if you run ‘cargo new’ within an
existing Git repository; you can override this behavior by using ‘cargo
new --vcs=git’.

Note: Git is a common version control system.  You can change ‘cargo
new’ to use a different version control system or no version control
system by using the ‘--vcs’ flag.  Run ‘cargo new --help’ to see the
available options.

Open ‘Cargo.toml’ in your text editor of choice.  It should look similar
to the code in Listing 1-2.

[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]

This file is in the ‘TOML’ (https://toml.io) (‘Tom's Obvious, Minimal
Language’) format, which is Cargo's configuration format.

The first line, ‘[package]’, is a section heading that indicates that
the following statements are configuring a package.  As we add more
information to this file, we'll add other sections.

The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to
compile your program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to
use.  We'll talk about the ‘edition’ key in *note Appendix E: Appendix E
- Editions.

The last line, ‘[dependencies]’, is the start of a section for you to
list any of your project's dependencies.  In Rust, packages of code are
referred to as ‘crates’.  We won't need any other crates for this
project, but we will in the first project in Chapter 2, so we'll use
this dependencies section then.

Now open ‘src/main.rs’ and take a look:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

Cargo has generated a “Hello, world!” program for you, just like the one
we wrote in Listing 1-1!  So far, the differences between our project
and the project Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the
‘src’ directory and we have a ‘Cargo.toml’ configuration file in the top
directory.

Cargo expects your source files to live inside the ‘src’ directory.  The
top-level project directory is just for README files, license
information, configuration files, and anything else not related to your
code.  Using Cargo helps you organize your projects.  There's a place
for everything, and everything is in its place.

If you started a project that doesn't use Cargo, as we did with the
“Hello, world!” project, you can convert it to a project that does use
Cargo.  Move the project code into the ‘src’ directory and create an
appropriate ‘Cargo.toml’ file.  One easy way to get that ‘Cargo.toml’
file is to run ‘cargo init’, which will create it for you automatically.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Building and Running a Cargo Project,  Next: Building for Release,  Prev: Creating a Project with Cargo,  Up: Hello Cargo!

4.1.3.2 Building and Running a Cargo Project
............................................

Now let's look at what's different when we build and run the “Hello,
world!” program with Cargo!  From your ‘hello_cargo’ directory, build
your project by entering the following command:

$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs

This command creates an executable file in ‘target/debug/hello_cargo’
(or ‘target\debug\hello_cargo.exe’ on Windows) rather than in your
current directory.  Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo
puts the binary in a directory named ‘debug’.  You can run the
executable with this command:

$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
Hello, world!

If all goes well, ‘Hello, world!’ should print to the terminal.  Running
‘cargo build’ for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file
at the top level: ‘Cargo.lock’.  This file keeps track of the exact
versions of dependencies in your project.  This project doesn't have
dependencies, so the file is a bit sparse.  You won't ever need to
change this file manually; Cargo manages its contents for you.

We just built a project with ‘cargo build’ and ran it with
‘./target/debug/hello_cargo’, but we can also use ‘cargo run’ to compile
the code and then run the resultant executable all in one command:

$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!

Using ‘cargo run’ is more convenient than having to remember to run
‘cargo build’ and then use the whole path to the binary, so most
developers use ‘cargo run’.

Notice that this time we didn't see output indicating that Cargo was
compiling ‘hello_cargo’.  Cargo figured out that the files hadn't
changed, so it didn't rebuild but just ran the binary.  If you had
modified your source code, Cargo would have rebuilt the project before
running it, and you would have seen this output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!

Cargo also provides a command called ‘cargo check’.  This command
quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn't produce an
executable:

$ cargo check
   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs

Why would you not want an executable?  Often, ‘cargo check’ is much
faster than ‘cargo build’ because it skips the step of producing an
executable.  If you're continually checking your work while writing the
code, using ‘cargo check’ will speed up the process of letting you know
if your project is still compiling!  As such, many Rustaceans run ‘cargo
check’ periodically as they write their program to make sure it
compiles.  Then they run ‘cargo build’ when they're ready to use the
executable.

Let's recap what we've learned so far about Cargo:

   • We can create a project using ‘cargo new’.
   • We can build a project using ‘cargo build’.
   • We can build and run a project in one step using ‘cargo run’.
   • We can build a project without producing a binary to check for
     errors using ‘cargo check’.
   • Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as
     our code, Cargo stores it in the ‘target/debug’ directory.

An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same
no matter which operating system you're working on.  So, at this point,
we'll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus
Windows.

4.1.3.3 Building for Release
............................

When your project is finally ready for release, you can use ‘cargo build
--release’ to compile it with optimizations.  This command will create
an executable in ‘target/release’ instead of ‘target/debug’.  The
optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on
lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile.  This is why
there are two different profiles: one for development, when you want to
rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final program
you'll give to a user that won't be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run
as fast as possible.  If you're benchmarking your code's running time,
be sure to run ‘cargo build --release’ and benchmark with the executable
in ‘target/release’.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Cargo as Convention,  Next: Summary,  Prev: Building for Release,  Up: Hello Cargo!

4.1.3.4 Cargo as Convention
...........................

With simple projects, Cargo doesn't provide a lot of value over just
using ‘rustc’, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more
intricate.  Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency,
it's much easier to let Cargo coordinate the build.

Even though the ‘hello_cargo’ project is simple, it now uses much of the
real tooling you'll use in the rest of your Rust career.  In fact, to
work on any existing projects, you can use the following commands to
check out the code using Git, change to that project's directory, and
build:

$ git clone example.org/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build

(https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

You're already off to a great start on your Rust journey!  In this
chapter, you've learned how to:

   • Install the latest stable version of Rust using ‘rustup’
   • Update to a newer Rust version
   • Open locally installed documentation
   • Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using ‘rustc’ directly
   • Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo

This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to
reading and writing Rust code.  So, in Chapter 2, we'll build a guessing

This chapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you
how to use them in a real program.  You'll learn about ‘let’, ‘match’,
methods, associated functions, external crates, and more!  In the
following chapters, we'll explore these ideas in more detail.  In this
chapter, you'll just practice the fundamentals.

We'll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game.
Here's how it works: the program will generate a random integer between
1 and 100.  It will then prompt the player to enter a guess.  After a
guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low
or too high.  If the guess is correct, the game will print a
congratulatory message and exit.

5.1 Setting Up a New Project
============================

To set up a new project, go to the ‘projects’ directory that you created
in Chapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:

$ cargo new guessing_game
$ cd guessing_game

The first command, ‘cargo new’, takes the name of the project
(‘guessing_game’) as the first argument.  The second command changes to
the new project's directory.

Look at the generated ‘Cargo.toml’ file:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]

As you saw in Chapter 1, ‘cargo new’ generates a “Hello, world!” program
for you.  Check out the ‘src/main.rs’ file:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

Now let's compile this “Hello, world!” program and run it in the same
step using the ‘cargo run’ command:

$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.20s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Hello, world!

The ‘run’ command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a
project, as we'll do in this game, quickly testing each iteration before
moving on to the next one.

Reopen the ‘src/main.rs’ file.  You'll be writing all the code in this
file.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Processing a Guess,  Next: Generating a Secret Number,  Prev: Setting Up a New Project,  Up: Programming a Guessing Game

5.2 Processing a Guess
======================

The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input,
process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form.
To start, we'll allow the player to input a guess.  Enter the code in
Listing 2-1 into ‘src/main.rs’.

use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}

This code contains a lot of information, so let's go over it line by
line.  To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need
to bring the ‘io’ input/output library into scope.  The ‘io’ library
comes from the standard library, known as ‘std’:

use std::io;

By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that
it brings into the scope of every program.  This set is called the
‘prelude’, and you can see everything in it in the standard library
documentation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/prelude/index.html).

If a type you want to use isn't in the prelude, you have to bring that
type into scope explicitly with a ‘use’ statement.  Using the ‘std::io’
library provides you with a number of useful features, including the
ability to accept user input.

As you saw in Chapter 1, the ‘main’ function is the entry point into the
program:

fn main() {

The ‘fn’ syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, ‘()’, indicate
there are no parameters; and the curly bracket, ‘{’, starts the body of
the function.

As you also learned in Chapter 1, ‘println!’ is a macro that prints a
string to the screen:

    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting
input from the user.

* Testing the First Part::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Storing Values with Variables,  Next: Receiving User Input,  Prev: Processing a Guess,  Up: Processing a Guess

5.2.1 Storing Values with Variables
-----------------------------------

Next, we'll create a ‘variable’ to store the user input, like this:

    let mut guess = String::new();

Now the program is getting interesting!  There's a lot going on in this
little line.  We use the ‘let’ statement to create the variable.  Here's
another example:

let apples = 5;

This line creates a new variable named ‘apples’ and binds it to the
value 5.  In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we
give the variable a value, the value won't change.  We'll be discussing
this concept in detail in the *note “Variables and Mutability”:
Variables and Mutability. section in Chapter 3.  To make a variable
mutable, we add ‘mut’ before the variable name:

let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable

Note: The ‘//’ syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of
the line.  Rust ignores everything in comments.  We'll discuss comments
in more detail in *note Chapter 3: Comments.

Returning to the guessing game program, you now know that ‘let mut
guess’ will introduce a mutable variable named ‘guess’.  The equal sign
(‘=’) tells Rust we want to bind something to the variable now.  On the
right of the equal sign is the value that ‘guess’ is bound to, which is
the result of calling ‘String::new’, a function that returns a new
instance of a ‘String’.  ‘String’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/string/struct.String.html) is a
string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8
encoded bit of text.

The ‘::’ syntax in the ‘::new’ line indicates that ‘new’ is an
associated function of the ‘String’ type.  An ‘associated function’ is a
function that's implemented on a type, in this case ‘String’.  This
‘new’ function creates a new, empty string.  You'll find a ‘new’
function on many types because it's a common name for a function that
makes a new value of some kind.

In full, the ‘let mut guess = String::new();’ line has created a mutable
variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a ‘String’.
Whew!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Receiving User Input,  Next: Handling Potential Failure with Result,  Prev: Storing Values with Variables,  Up: Processing a Guess

5.2.2 Receiving User Input
--------------------------

Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard
library with ‘use std::io;’ on the first line of the program.  Now we'll
call the ‘stdin’ function from the ‘io’ module, which will allow us to
handle user input:

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)

If we hadn't imported the ‘io’ library with ‘use std::io;’ at the
beginning of the program, we could still use the function by writing
this function call as ‘std::io::stdin’.  The ‘stdin’ function returns an
instance of ‘stdioStdin’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/io/struct.Stdin.html), which is a
type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.

Next, the line ‘.read_line(&mut guess)’ calls the ‘read_line’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/io/struct.Stdin.html) method on
the standard input handle to get input from the user.  We're also
passing ‘&mut guess’ as the argument to ‘read_line’ to tell it what
string to store the user input in.  The full job of ‘read_line’ is to
take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a
string (without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that
string as an argument.  The string argument needs to be mutable so the
method can change the string's content.

The ‘&’ indicates that this argument is a ‘reference’, which gives you a
way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without
needing to copy that data into memory multiple times.  References are a
complex feature, and one of Rust's major advantages is how safe and easy
it is to use references.  You don't need to know a lot of those details
to finish this program.  For now, all you need to know is that, like
variables, references are immutable by default.  Hence, you need to
write ‘&mut guess’ rather than ‘&guess’ to make it mutable.  (Chapter 4
will explain references more thoroughly.)


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Handling Potential Failure with Result,  Next: Printing Values with println! Placeholders,  Prev: Receiving User Input,  Up: Processing a Guess

5.2.3 Handling Potential Failure with ‘Result’
----------------------------------------------

We're still working on this line of code.  We're now discussing a third
line of text, but note that it's still part of a single logical line of
code.  The next part is this method:

        .expect("Failed to read line");

We could have written this code as:

io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");

However, one long line is difficult to read, so it's best to divide it.
It's often wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help
break up long lines when you call a method with the ‘.method_name()’
syntax.  Now let's discuss what this line does.

As mentioned earlier, ‘read_line’ puts whatever the user enters into the
string we pass to it, but it also returns a ‘Result’ value.  ‘Result’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/result/enum.Result.html) is an
*note ‘enumeration’: Enums and Pattern Matching, often called an ‘enum’,
which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states.  We call
each possible state a ‘variant’.

*note Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching. will cover enums in more
detail.  The purpose of these ‘Result’ types is to encode error-handling
information.

‘Result’'s variants are ‘Ok’ and ‘Err’.  The ‘Ok’ variant indicates the
operation was successful, and inside ‘Ok’ is the successfully generated
value.  The ‘Err’ variant means the operation failed, and ‘Err’ contains
information about how or why the operation failed.

Values of the ‘Result’ type, like values of any type, have methods
defined on them.  An instance of ‘Result’ has an ‘expect’ method
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/result/enum.Result.html) that you
can call.  If this instance of ‘Result’ is an ‘Err’ value, ‘expect’ will
cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an
argument to ‘expect’.  If the ‘read_line’ method returns an ‘Err’, it
would likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying
operating system.  If this instance of ‘Result’ is an ‘Ok’ value,
‘expect’ will take the return value that ‘Ok’ is holding and return just
that value to you so you can use it.  In this case, that value is the
number of bytes in the user's input.

If you don't call ‘expect’, the program will compile, but you'll get a
warning:

$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
warning: unused `Result` that must be used
  --> src/main.rs:10:5
   |

   |     +++++++

warning: `guessing_game` (bin "guessing_game") generated 1 warning
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s

Rust warns that you haven't used the ‘Result’ value returned from
‘read_line’, indicating that the program hasn't handled a possible
error.

The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write
error-handling code, but in our case we just want to crash this program
when a problem occurs, so we can use ‘expect’.  You'll learn about
recovering from errors in *note Chapter 9: Recoverable Errors with
Result.

5.2.4 Printing Values with ‘println!’ Placeholders
--------------------------------------------------

Aside from the closing curly bracket, there's only one more line to
discuss in the code so far:

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

This line prints the string that now contains the user's input.  The
‘{}’ set of curly brackets is a placeholder: think of ‘{}’ as little
crab pincers that hold a value in place.  When printing the value of a
variable, the variable name can go inside the curly brackets.  When
printing the result of evaluating an expression, place empty curly
brackets in the format string, then follow the format string with a
comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty curly bracket
placeholder in the same order.  Printing a variable and the result of an
expression in one call to ‘println!’ would look like this:

let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);

This code would print ‘x = 5 and y + 2 = 12’.

5.2.5 Testing the First Part
----------------------------

Let's test the first part of the guessing game.  Run it using ‘cargo
run’:

$ cargo run

You guessed: 6

At this point, the first part of the game is done: we're getting input
from the keyboard and then printing it.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Generating a Secret Number,  Next: Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number,  Prev: Processing a Guess,  Up: Programming a Guessing Game

5.3 Generating a Secret Number
==============================

Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to
guess.  The secret number should be different every time so the game is
fun to play more than once.  We'll use a random number between 1 and 100
so the game isn't too difficult.  Rust doesn't yet include random number
functionality in its standard library.  However, the Rust team does
provide a ‘rand’ crate (https://crates.io/crates/rand) with said
functionality.

* Using a Crate to Get More Functionality::
* Generating a Random Number::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Using a Crate to Get More Functionality,  Next: Generating a Random Number,  Prev: Generating a Secret Number,  Up: Generating a Secret Number

5.3.1 Using a Crate to Get More Functionality
---------------------------------------------

Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files.  The
project we've been building is a ‘binary crate’, which is an executable.
The ‘rand’ crate is a ‘library crate’, which contains code that is
intended to be used in other programs and can't be executed on its own.

Cargo's coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines.
Before we can write code that uses ‘rand’, we need to modify the
‘Cargo.toml’ file to include the ‘rand’ crate as a dependency.  Open
that file now and add the following line to the bottom, beneath the
‘[dependencies]’ section header that Cargo created for you.  Be sure to
specify ‘rand’ exactly as we have here, with this version number, or the
code examples in this tutorial may not work:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"

In the ‘Cargo.toml’ file, everything that follows a header is part of
that section that continues until another section starts.  In
‘[dependencies]’ you tell Cargo which external crates your project
depends on and which versions of those crates you require.  In this
case, we specify the ‘rand’ crate with the semantic version specifier
‘0.8.5’.  Cargo understands Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org)
(sometimes called ‘SemVer’), which is a standard for writing version
numbers.  The specifier ‘0.8.5’ is actually shorthand for ‘^0.8.5’,
which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0.

Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with
version 0.8.5, and this specification ensures you'll get the latest
patch release that will still compile with the code in this chapter.
Any version 0.9.0 or greater is not guaranteed to have the same API as
what the following examples use.

Now, without changing any of the code, let's build the project, as shown
in Listing 2-2.

$ cargo build
    Updating crates.io index
     Locking 16 packages to latest compatible versions

   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3.69s

You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible
with the code, thanks to SemVer!)  and different lines (depending on the
operating system), and the lines may be in a different order.

When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest
versions of everything that dependency needs from the ‘registry’, which
is a copy of data from Cratesio (https://crates.io/).  Crates.io is
where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects
for others to use.

After updating the registry, Cargo checks the ‘[dependencies]’ section
and downloads any crates listed that aren't already downloaded.  In this
case, although we only listed ‘rand’ as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed
other crates that ‘rand’ depends on to work.  After downloading the
crates, Rust compiles them and then compiles the project with the
dependencies available.

If you immediately run ‘cargo build’ again without making any changes,
you won't get any output aside from the ‘Finished’ line.  Cargo knows it
has already downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven't
changed anything about them in your ‘Cargo.toml’ file.  Cargo also knows
that you haven't changed anything about your code, so it doesn't
recompile that either.  With nothing to do, it simply exits.

If you open the ‘src/main.rs’ file, make a trivial change, and then save
it and build again, you'll only see two lines of output:

$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s

These lines show that Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change
to the ‘src/main.rs’ file.  Your dependencies haven't changed, so Cargo
knows it can reuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for
those.

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargolock File,  Next: Updating a Crate to Get a New Version,  Prev: Using a Crate to Get More Functionality,  Up: Using a Crate to Get More Functionality

5.3.1.1 Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the ‘Cargo.lock’
..........................................................

File Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same
artifact every time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use
only the versions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate
otherwise.  For example, say that next week version 0.8.6 of the ‘rand’
crate comes out, and that version contains an important bug fix, but it
also contains a regression that will break your code.  To handle this,
Rust creates the ‘Cargo.lock’ file the first time you run ‘cargo build’,
so we now have this in the ‘guessing_game’ directory.

When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the
versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them
to the ‘Cargo.lock’ file.  When you build your project in the future,
Cargo will see that the ‘Cargo.lock’ file exists and will use the
versions specified there rather than doing all the work of figuring out
versions again.  This lets you have a reproducible build automatically.
In other words, your project will remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly
upgrade, thanks to the ‘Cargo.lock’ file.  Because the ‘Cargo.lock’ file
is important for reproducible builds, it's often checked into source
control with the rest of the code in your project.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Updating a Crate to Get a New Version,  Next: Generating a Random Number,  Prev: Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargolock File,  Up: Using a Crate to Get More Functionality

5.3.1.2 Updating a Crate to Get a New Version
.............................................

When you ‘do’ want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command
‘update’, which will ignore the ‘Cargo.lock’ file and figure out all the
latest versions that fit your specifications in ‘Cargo.toml’.  Cargo
will then write those versions to the ‘Cargo.lock’ file.  In this case,
Cargo will only look for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than
0.9.0.  If the ‘rand’ crate has released the two new versions 0.8.6 and
0.9.0, you would see the following if you ran ‘cargo update’:

$ cargo update
    Updating crates.io index
    Updating rand v0.8.5 -> v0.8.6

Cargo ignores the 0.9.0 release.  At this point, you would also notice a
change in your ‘Cargo.lock’ file noting that the version of the ‘rand’
crate you are now using is 0.8.6.  To use ‘rand’ version 0.9.0 or any
version in the 0.9.‘x’ series, you'd have to update the ‘Cargo.toml’
file to look like this instead:

[dependencies]
rand = "0.9.0"

The next time you run ‘cargo build’, Cargo will update the registry of
crates available and reevaluate your ‘rand’ requirements according to
the new version you have specified.

There's a lot more to say about Cargo (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
and its ecosystem
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html), which we'll
discuss in Chapter 14, but for now, that's all you need to know.  Cargo
makes it very easy to reuse libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write
smaller projects that are assembled from a number of packages.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Generating a Random Number,  Next: Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number,  Prev: Using a Crate to Get More Functionality,  Up: Generating a Secret Number

5.3.2 Generating a Random Number
--------------------------------

Let's start using ‘rand’ to generate a number to guess.  The next step
is to update ‘src/main.rs’, as shown in Listing 2-3.

use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
}

First we add the line ‘use rand::Rng;’.  The ‘Rng’ trait defines methods
that random number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope
for us to use those methods.  Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.

Next, we're adding two lines in the middle.  In the first line, we call
the ‘rand::thread_rng’ function that gives us the particular random
number generator we're going to use: one that is local to the current
thread of execution and is seeded by the operating system.  Then we call
the ‘gen_range’ method on the random number generator.  This method is
defined by the ‘Rng’ trait that we brought into scope with the ‘use
rand::Rng;’ statement.  The ‘gen_range’ method takes a range expression
as an argument and generates a random number in the range.  The kind of
range expression we're using here takes the form ‘start..=end’ and is
inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we need to specify ‘1..=100’
to request a number between 1 and 100.

Note: You won't just know which traits to use and which methods and
functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with
instructions for using it.  Another neat feature of Cargo is that
running the ‘cargo doc --open’ command will build documentation provided
by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser.  If you're
interested in other functionality in the ‘rand’ crate, for example, run
‘cargo doc --open’ and click ‘rand’ in the sidebar on the left.

The second new line prints the secret number.  This is useful while
we're developing the program to be able to test it, but we'll delete it
from the final version.  It's not much of a game if the program prints
the answer as soon as it starts!

Try running the program a few times:

$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 7
Please input your guess.
4
You guessed: 4

$ cargo run
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 83
Please input your guess.
5
You guessed: 5

You should get different random numbers, and they should all be numbers
between 1 and 100.  Great job!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number,  Next: Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping,  Prev: Generating a Secret Number,  Up: Programming a Guessing Game

5.4 Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number
============================================

Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them.
That step is shown in Listing 2-4.  Note that this code won't compile
just yet, as we will explain.

use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}

First we add another ‘use’ statement, bringing a type called
‘std::cmp::Ordering’ into scope from the standard library.  The
‘Ordering’ type is another enum and has the variants ‘Less’, ‘Greater’,
and ‘Equal’.  These are the three outcomes that are possible when you
compare two values.

Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the ‘Ordering’ type.
The ‘cmp’ method compares two values and can be called on anything that
can be compared.  It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare
with: here it's comparing ‘guess’ to ‘secret_number’.  Then it returns a
variant of the ‘Ordering’ enum we brought into scope with the ‘use’
statement.  We use a *note ‘match’: The match Control Flow Construct.
expression to decide what to do next based on which variant of
‘Ordering’ was returned from the call to ‘cmp’ with the values in
‘guess’ and ‘secret_number’.

A ‘match’ expression is made up of ‘arms’.  An arm consists of a
‘pattern’ to match against, and the code that should be run if the value
given to ‘match’ fits that arm's pattern.  Rust takes the value given to
‘match’ and looks through each arm's pattern in turn.  Patterns and the
‘match’ construct are powerful Rust features: they let you express a
variety of situations your code might encounter and they make sure you
handle them all.  These features will be covered in detail in Chapter 6
and Chapter 19, respectively.

Let's walk through an example with the ‘match’ expression we use here.
Say that the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret
number this time is 38.

When the code compares 50 to 38, the ‘cmp’ method will return
‘Ordering::Greater’ because 50 is greater than 38.  The ‘match’
expression gets the ‘Ordering::Greater’ value and starts checking each
arm's pattern.  It looks at the first arm's pattern, ‘Ordering::Less’,
and sees that the value ‘Ordering::Greater’ does not match
‘Ordering::Less’, so it ignores the code in that arm and moves to the
next arm.  The next arm's pattern is ‘Ordering::Greater’, which ‘does’
match ‘Ordering::Greater’!  The associated code in that arm will execute
and print ‘Too big!’ to the screen.  The ‘match’ expression ends after
the first successful match, so it won't look at the last arm in this
scenario.

However, the code in Listing 2-4 won't compile yet.  Let's try it:

error: could not compile `guessing_game` (bin "guessing_game") due to 1 previous error

The core of the error states that there are ‘mismatched types’.  Rust
has a strong, static type system.  However, it also has type inference.
When we wrote ‘let mut guess = String::new()’, Rust was able to infer
that ‘guess’ should be a ‘String’ and didn't make us write the type.
The ‘secret_number’, on the other hand, is a number type.  A few of
Rust's number types can have a value between 1 and 100: ‘i32’, a 32-bit
number; ‘u32’, an unsigned 32-bit number; ‘i64’, a 64-bit number; as
well as others.  Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to an ‘i32’,
which is the type of ‘secret_number’ unless you add type information
elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type.
The reason for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a
number type.

Ultimately, we want to convert the ‘String’ the program reads as input
into a number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret
number.  We do so by adding this line to the ‘main’ function body:

Filename: src/main.rs

    // --snip--

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }

The line is:

let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

We create a variable named ‘guess’.  But wait, doesn't the program
already have a variable named ‘guess’?  It does, but helpfully Rust
allows us to shadow the previous value of ‘guess’ with a new one.
‘Shadowing’ lets us reuse the ‘guess’ variable name rather than forcing
us to create two unique variables, such as ‘guess_str’ and ‘guess’, for
example.  We'll cover this in more detail in *note Chapter 3: Shadowing,
but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want to
convert a value from one type to another type.

We bind this new variable to the expression ‘guess.trim().parse()’.  The
‘guess’ in the expression refers to the original ‘guess’ variable that
contained the input as a string.  The ‘trim’ method on a ‘String’
instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which
we must do before we can convert the string to a ‘u32’, which can only
contain numerical data.  The user must press enter to satisfy
‘read_line’ and input their guess, which adds a newline character to the
string.  For example, if the user types 5 and presses enter, ‘guess’
looks like this: ‘5\n’.  The ‘\n’ represents “newline.” (On Windows,
pressing enter results in a carriage return and a newline, ‘\r\n’.)  The
‘trim’ method eliminates ‘\n’ or ‘\r\n’, resulting in just ‘5’.

The ‘parse’ method on strings
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/primitive.str.html) converts a
string to another type.  Here, we use it to convert from a string to a
number.  We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using
‘let guess: u32’.  The colon (‘:’) after ‘guess’ tells Rust we'll
annotate the variable's type.  Rust has a few built-in number types; the
‘u32’ seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer.  It's a good default
choice for a small positive number.  You'll learn about other number
types in *note Chapter 3:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch03-02-data-typesmd__integer-types.

Additionally, the ‘u32’ annotation in this example program and the
comparison with ‘secret_number’ means Rust will infer that
‘secret_number’ should be a ‘u32’ as well.  So now the comparison will
be between two values of the same type!

The ‘parse’ method will only work on characters that can logically be
converted into numbers and so can easily cause errors.  If, for example,
the string contained ‘A👍%’, there would be no way to convert that to a
number.  Because it might fail, the ‘parse’ method returns a ‘Result’
type, much as the ‘read_line’ method does (discussed earlier in *note
“Handling Potential Failure with ‘Result’”: Handling Potential Failure
with Result.).  We'll treat this ‘Result’ the same way by using the
‘expect’ method again.  If ‘parse’ returns an ‘Err’ ‘Result’ variant
because it couldn't create a number from the string, the ‘expect’ call
will crash the game and print the message we give it.  If ‘parse’ can
successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the ‘Ok’
variant of ‘Result’, and ‘expect’ will return the number that we want
from the ‘Ok’ value.

Let's run the program now:

$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.26s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 58
Please input your guess.
  76
You guessed: 76
Too big!

Nice!  Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still
figured out that the user guessed 76.  Run the program a few times to
verify the different behavior with different kinds of input: guess the
number correctly, guess a number that is too high, and guess a number
that is too low.

We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one
guess.  Let's change that by adding a loop!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping,  Next: Summary 2,  Prev: Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number,  Up: Programming a Guessing Game

5.5 Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping
==========================================

The ‘loop’ keyword creates an infinite loop.  We'll add a loop to give
users more chances at guessing the number:

Filename: src/main.rs

    // --snip--

    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        // --snip--

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }
}

As you can see, we've moved everything from the guess input prompt
onward into a loop.  Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another
four spaces each and run the program again.  The program will now ask
for another guess forever, which actually introduces a new problem.  It
doesn't seem like the user can quit!

The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard
shortcut ctrl-c.  But there's another way to escape this insatiable
monster, as mentioned in the ‘parse’ discussion in *note “Comparing the
Guess to the Secret Number”: Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number.:
if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash.  We can
take advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:

$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.23s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`

Please input your guess.
45
You guessed: 45
Too small!
Please input your guess.
60
You guessed: 60
Too big!
Please input your guess.
59
You guessed: 59
You win!
Please input your guess.
quit
thread 'main' panicked at 'Please type a number!: ParseIntError { kind: InvalidDigit }', src/main.rs:28:47
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

Typing ‘quit’ will quit the game, but as you'll notice, so will entering
any other non-number input.  This is suboptimal, to say the least; we
want the game to also stop when the correct number is guessed.

* Handling Invalid Input::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Quitting After a Correct Guess,  Next: Handling Invalid Input,  Prev: Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping,  Up: Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping

5.5.1 Quitting After a Correct Guess
------------------------------------

Let's program the game to quit when the user wins by adding a ‘break’
statement:

Filename: src/main.rs

        // --snip--

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

Adding the ‘break’ line after ‘You win!’ makes the program exit the loop
when the user guesses the secret number correctly.  Exiting the loop
also means exiting the program, because the loop is the last part of
‘main’.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Handling Invalid Input,  Next: Summary 2,  Prev: Quitting After a Correct Guess,  Up: Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping

5.5.2 Handling Invalid Input
----------------------------

To further refine the game's behavior, rather than crashing the program
when the user inputs a non-number, let's make the game ignore a
non-number so the user can continue guessing.  We can do that by
altering the line where ‘guess’ is converted from a ‘String’ to a ‘u32’,
as shown in Listing 2-5.

        // --snip--

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {guess}");

        // --snip--

We switch from an ‘expect’ call to a ‘match’ expression to move from
crashing on an error to handling the error.  Remember that ‘parse’
returns a ‘Result’ type and ‘Result’ is an enum that has the variants
‘Ok’ and ‘Err’.  We're using a ‘match’ expression here, as we did with
the ‘Ordering’ result of the ‘cmp’ method.

If ‘parse’ is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it
will return an ‘Ok’ value that contains the resultant number.  That ‘Ok’
value will match the first arm's pattern, and the ‘match’ expression
will just return the ‘num’ value that ‘parse’ produced and put inside
the ‘Ok’ value.  That number will end up right where we want it in the
new ‘guess’ variable we're creating.

If ‘parse’ is ‘not’ able to turn the string into a number, it will
return an ‘Err’ value that contains more information about the error.
The ‘Err’ value does not match the ‘Ok(num)’ pattern in the first
‘match’ arm, but it does match the ‘Err(_)’ pattern in the second arm.
The underscore, ‘_’, is a catchall value; in this example, we're saying
we want to match all ‘Err’ values, no matter what information they have
inside them.  So the program will execute the second arm's code,
‘continue’, which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the
‘loop’ and ask for another guess.  So, effectively, the program ignores
all errors that ‘parse’ might encounter!

Now everything in the program should work as expected.  Let's try it:

$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 61
Please input your guess.
10
You guessed: 10
Too small!
Please input your guess.
99
You guessed: 99
Too big!
Please input your guess.
foo
Please input your guess.
61
You guessed: 61
You win!

Awesome!  With one tiny final tweak, we will finish the guessing game.
Recall that the program is still printing the secret number.  That
worked well for testing, but it ruins the game.  Let's delete the
‘println!’ that outputs the secret number.  Listing 2-6 shows the final
code.

use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {guess}");

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

At this point, you've successfully built the guessing game.
Congratulations!

5.6 Summary
===========

This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust
concepts: ‘let’, ‘match’, functions, the use of external crates, and
more.  In the next few chapters, you'll learn about these concepts in
more detail.  Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages
have, such as variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use
them in Rust.  Chapter 4 explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust
different from other languages.  Chapter 5 discusses structs and method
syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.

6 Common Programming Concepts
*****************************

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming
language and how they work in Rust.  Many programming languages have
much in common at their core.  None of the concepts presented in this
chapter are unique to Rust, but we'll discuss them in the context of
Rust and explain the conventions around using these concepts.

Specifically, you'll learn about variables, basic types, functions,
comments, and control flow.  These foundations will be in every Rust
program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start
from.

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Keywords,  Next: Variables and Mutability,  Prev: Common Programming Concepts,  Up: Common Programming Concepts

6.1 Keywords
============

The Rust language has a set of ‘keywords’ that are reserved for use by
the language only, much as in other languages.  Keep in mind that you
cannot use these words as names of variables or functions.  Most of the
keywords have special meanings, and you'll be using them to do various
tasks in your Rust programs; a few have no current functionality
associated with them but have been reserved for functionality that might
be added to Rust in the future.  You can find a list of the keywords in
*note Appendix A: Appendix A Keywords.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Variables and Mutability,  Next: Data Types,  Prev: Keywords,  Up: Common Programming Concepts

6.2 Variables and Mutability
============================

As mentioned in the *note “Storing Values with Variables”: Storing
Values with Variables. section, by default, variables are immutable.
This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write your code in a way
that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust
offers.  However, you still have the option to make your variables
mutable.  Let's explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor
immutability and why sometimes you might want to opt out.

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can't
change that value.  To illustrate this, generate a new project called
‘variables’ in your ‘projects’ directory by using ‘cargo new variables’.

Then, in your new ‘variables’ directory, open ‘src/main.rs’ and replace
its code with the following code, which won't compile just yet:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

Save and run the program using ‘cargo run’.  You should receive an error
message regarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`

  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
  |
help: consider making this binding mutable
  |
2 |     let mut x = 5;
  |         +++

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.
error: could not compile `variables` (bin "variables") due to 1 previous error

This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your
programs.  Compiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean
your program isn't safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do
‘not’ mean that you're not a good programmer!  Experienced Rustaceans
still get compiler errors.

You received the error message ‘cannot assign twice to immutable
variable `x`’ because you tried to assign a second value to the
immutable ‘x’ variable.

It's important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change
a value that's designated as immutable because this very situation can
lead to bugs.  If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a
value will never change and another part of our code changes that value,
it's possible that the first part of the code won't do what it was
designed to do.  The cause of this kind of bug can be difficult to track
down after the fact, especially when the second piece of code changes
the value only ‘sometimes’.  The Rust compiler guarantees that when you
state that a value won't change, it really won't change, so you don't
have to keep track of it yourself.  Your code is thus easier to reason
through.

But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to
write.  Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them
mutable by adding ‘mut’ in front of the variable name as you did in
*note Chapter 2: Storing Values with Variables.  Adding ‘mut’ also
conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other
parts of the code will be changing this variable's value.

For example, let's change ‘src/main.rs’ to the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

When we run the program now, we get this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6

We're allowed to change the value bound to ‘x’ from ‘5’ to ‘6’ when
‘mut’ is used.  Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is
up to you and depends on what you think is clearest in that particular
situation.

* Menu:

* Constants::
* Shadowing::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Constants,  Next: Shadowing,  Prev: Variables and Mutability,  Up: Variables and Mutability

6.2.1 Constants
---------------

Like immutable variables, ‘constants’ are values that are bound to a
name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences
between constants and variables.

First, you aren't allowed to use ‘mut’ with constants.  Constants aren't
just immutable by default--they're always immutable.  You declare
constants using the ‘const’ keyword instead of the ‘let’ keyword, and
the type of the value ‘must’ be annotated.  We'll cover types and type
annotations in the next section, *note “Data Types”: Data Types, so
don't worry about the details right now.  Just know that you must always
annotate the type.

Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope,
which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know
about.

The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant
expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at
runtime.

Here's an example of a constant declaration:

const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;

The constant's name is ‘THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS’ and its value is set to
the result of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60
(the number of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to
count in this program).  Rust's naming convention for constants is to
use all uppercase with underscores between words.  The compiler is able
to evaluate a limited set of operations at compile time, which lets us
choose to write out this value in a way that's easier to understand and
verify, rather than setting this constant to the value 10,800.  See the
Rust Reference's section on constant evaluation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../reference/const_eval.html) for more
information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.

Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope
in which they were declared.  This property makes constants useful for
values in your application domain that multiple parts of the program
might need to know about, such as the maximum number of points any
player of a game is allowed to earn, or the speed of light.

Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is
useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of
the code.  It also helps to have only one place in your code you would
need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the
future.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Shadowing,  Next: Data Types,  Prev: Constants,  Up: Variables and Mutability

6.2.2 Shadowing
---------------

As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in *note Chapter 2: Comparing
the Guess to the Secret Number, you can declare a new variable with the
same name as a previous variable.  Rustaceans say that the first
variable is ‘shadowed’ by the second, which means that the second
variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the
variable.  In effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking
any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is
shadowed or the scope ends.  We can shadow a variable by using the same
variable's name and repeating the use of the ‘let’ keyword as follows:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

This program first binds ‘x’ to a value of ‘5’.  Then it creates a new
variable ‘x’ by repeating ‘let x =’, taking the original value and
adding ‘1’ so the value of ‘x’ is then ‘6’.  Then, within an inner scope
created with the curly brackets, the third ‘let’ statement also shadows
‘x’ and creates a new variable, multiplying the previous value by ‘2’ to
give ‘x’ a value of ‘12’.  When that scope is over, the inner shadowing
ends and ‘x’ returns to being ‘6’.  When we run this program, it will
output the following:

$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as ‘mut’ because we'll
get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this
variable without using the ‘let’ keyword.  By using ‘let’, we can
perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be
immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between ‘mut’ and shadowing is that because we're
effectively creating a new variable when we use the ‘let’ keyword again,
we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.  For
example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want
between some text by inputting space characters, and then we want to
store that input as a number:

    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();

The first ‘spaces’ variable is a string type and the second ‘spaces’
variable is a number type.  Shadowing thus spares us from having to come
up with different names, such as ‘spaces_str’ and ‘spaces_num’; instead,
we can reuse the simpler ‘spaces’ name.  However, if we try to use ‘mut’
for this, as shown here, we'll get a compile-time error:

    let mut spaces = "   ";
    spaces = spaces.len();

The error says we're not allowed to mutate a variable's type:

Now that we've explored how variables work, let's look at more data
types they can have.

6.3 Data Types
==============

Every value in Rust is of a certain ‘data type’, which tells Rust what
kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.
We'll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

Keep in mind that Rust is a ‘statically typed’ language, which means
that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.  The
compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value
and how we use it.  In cases when many types are possible, such as when
we converted a ‘String’ to a numeric type using ‘parse’ in the *note
“Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number”: Comparing the Guess to the
Secret Number. section in Chapter 2, we must add a type annotation, like
this:

let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");

If we don't add the ‘: u32’ type annotation shown in the preceding code,
Rust will display the following error, which means the compiler needs
more information from us to know which type we want to use:

$ cargo build
   Compiling no_type_annotations v0.1.0 (file:///projects/no_type_annotations)

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Scalar Types,  Next: Compound Types,  Prev: Data Types,  Up: Data Types

6.3.1 Scalar Types
------------------

A ‘scalar’ type represents a single value.  Rust has four primary scalar
types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.  You
may recognize these from other programming languages.  Let's jump into
how they work in Rust.  Integer Types An ‘integer’ is a number without a
fractional component.  We used one integer type in Chapter 2, the ‘u32’
type.  This type declaration indicates that the value it's associated
with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with ‘i’
instead of ‘u’) that takes up 32 bits of space.  Table 3-1 shows the
built-in integer types in Rust.  We can use any of these variants to
declare the type of an integer value.

Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust

Length    Signed    Unsigned
------------------------------
8-bit     ‘i8’      ‘u8’
16-bit    ‘i16’     ‘u16’
32-bit    ‘i32’     ‘u32’
64-bit    ‘i64’     ‘u64’
128-bit   ‘i128’    ‘u128’
arch      ‘isize’   ‘usize’

Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.
‘Signed’ and ‘unsigned’ refer to whether it's possible for the number to
be negative--in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign
with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can
therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned).  It's like writing
numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus
sign or a minus sign; however, when it's safe to assume the number is
positive, it's shown with no sign.  Signed numbers are stored using
two's complement (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)
representation.

Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2^n - 1) to 2^n - 1 - 1
inclusive, where ‘n’ is the number of bits that variant uses.  So an
‘i8’ can store numbers from -(2^7) to 2^7 - 1, which equals -128 to 127.
Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a ‘u8’ can
store numbers from 0 to 2^8 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the ‘isize’ and ‘usize’ types depend on the architecture
of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the
table as “arch”: 64 bits if you're on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits
if you're on a 32-bit architecture.

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2.
Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a
type suffix, such as ‘57u8’, to designate the type.  Number literals can
also use ‘_’ as a visual separator to make the number easier to read,
such as ‘1_000’, which will have the same value as if you had specified
‘1000’.

Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust

Number literals    Example
-----------------------------------
Decimal            ‘98_222’
Hex                ‘0xff’
Octal              ‘0o77’
Binary             ‘0b1111_0000’
Byte (‘u8’ only)   ‘b'A'’

So how do you know which type of integer to use?  If you're unsure,
Rust's defaults are generally good places to start: integer types
default to ‘i32’.  The primary situation in which you'd use ‘isize’ or
‘usize’ is when indexing some sort of collection.

Integer Overflow Let's say you have a variable of type ‘u8’ that can
hold values between 0 and 255.  If you try to change the variable to a
value outside that range, such as 256, ‘integer overflow’ will occur,
which can result in one of two behaviors.  When you're compiling in
debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your
program to ‘panic’ at runtime if this behavior occurs.  Rust uses the
term ‘panicking’ when a program exits with an error; we'll discuss
panics in more depth in the *note “Unrecoverable Errors with ‘panic!’”:
Unrecoverable Errors with panic!. section in Chapter 9.

When you're compiling in release mode with the ‘--release’ flag, Rust
does ‘not’ include checks for integer overflow that cause panics.
Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs ‘two's complement wrapping’.
In short, values greater than the maximum value the type can hold “wrap
around” to the minimum of the values the type can hold.  In the case of
a ‘u8’, the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on.
The program won't panic, but the variable will have a value that
probably isn't what you were expecting it to have.  Relying on integer
overflow's wrapping behavior is considered an error.

To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these
families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive
numeric types:

   • Wrap in all modes with the ‘wrapping_*’ methods, such as
     ‘wrapping_add’.
   • Return the ‘None’ value if there is overflow with the ‘checked_*’
     methods.
   • Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was
     overflow with the ‘overflowing_*’ methods.
   • Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values with the
     ‘saturating_*’ methods.

Floating-Point Types Rust also has two primitive types for
‘floating-point numbers’, which are numbers with decimal points.  Rust's
floating-point types are ‘f32’ and ‘f64’, which are 32 bits and 64 bits
in size, respectively.  The default type is ‘f64’ because on modern
CPUs, it's roughly the same speed as ‘f32’ but is capable of more
precision.  All floating-point types are signed.

Here's an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754
standard.  Numeric Operations Rust supports the basic mathematical
operations you'd expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and remainder.  Integer division truncates
toward zero to the nearest integer.  The following code shows how you'd
use each numeric operation in a ‘let’ statement:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}

Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and
evaluates to a single value, which is then bound to a variable.  *note
Appendix B: Appendix B Operators and Symbols. contains a list of all
operators that Rust provides.  The Boolean Type As in most other
programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values:
‘true’ and ‘false’.  Booleans are one byte in size.  The Boolean type in
Rust is specified using ‘bool’.  For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}

The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an
‘if’ expression.  We'll cover how ‘if’ expressions work in Rust in the
*note “Control Flow”: Control Flow. section.  The Character Type Rust's
‘char’ type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type.  Here are
some examples of declaring ‘char’ values:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}

Note that we specify ‘char’ literals with single quotes, as opposed to
string literals, which use double quotes.  Rust's ‘char’ type is four
bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can
represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all
valid ‘char’ values in Rust.  Unicode Scalar Values range from ‘U+0000’
to ‘U+D7FF’ and ‘U+E000’ to ‘U+10FFFF’ inclusive.  However, a
“character” isn't really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition
for what a “character” is may not match up with what a ‘char’ is in
Rust.  We'll discuss this topic in detail in *note “Storing UTF-8
Encoded Text with Strings”: Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings. in
Chapter 8.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Compound Types,  Next: Functions,  Prev: Scalar Types,  Up: Data Types

6.3.2 Compound Types
--------------------

‘Compound types’ can group multiple values into one type.  Rust has two
primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.  The Tuple Type A ‘tuple’
is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety
of types into one compound type.  Tuples have a fixed length: once
declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside
parentheses.  Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of
the different values in the tuple don't have to be the same.  We've
added optional type annotations in this example:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}

The variable ‘tup’ binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is
considered a single compound element.  To get the individual values out
of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value,
like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}

This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable ‘tup’.
It then uses a pattern with ‘let’ to take ‘tup’ and turn it into three
separate variables, ‘x’, ‘y’, and ‘z’.  This is called ‘destructuring’
because it breaks the single tuple into three parts.  Finally, the
program prints the value of ‘y’, which is ‘6.4’.

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (‘.’)
followed by the index of the value we want to access.  For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}

This program creates the tuple ‘x’ and then accesses each element of the
tuple using their respective indices.  As with most programming
languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.

The tuple without any values has a special name, ‘unit’.  This value and
its corresponding type are both written ‘()’ and represent an empty
value or an empty return type.  Expressions implicitly return the unit
value if they don't return any other value.  The Array Type Another way
to have a collection of multiple values is with an ‘array’.  Unlike a
tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.  Unlike arrays
in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square
brackets:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack, the
same as the other types we have seen so far, rather than the heap (we
will discuss the stack and the heap more in *note Chapter 4: The Stack
and the Heap.) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number
of elements.  An array isn't as flexible as the vector type, though.  A
‘vector’ is a similar collection type provided by the standard library
that ‘is’ allowed to grow or shrink in size.  If you're unsure whether
to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector.  *note
Chapter 8: Storing Lists of Values with Vectors. discusses vectors in
more detail.

However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements
will not need to change.  For example, if you were using the names of
the month in a program, you would probably use an array rather than a
vector because you know it will always contain 12 elements:

let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];

You write an array's type using square brackets with the type of each
element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like
so:

let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Here, ‘i32’ is the type of each element.  After the semicolon, the
number ‘5’ indicates the array contains five elements.

You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each
element by specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and
then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:

let a = [3; 5];

The array named ‘a’ will contain ‘5’ elements that will all be set to
the value ‘3’ initially.  This is the same as writing ‘let a = [3, 3, 3,
3, 3];’ but in a more concise way.  Accessing Array Elements An array is
a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on
the stack.  You can access elements of an array using indexing, like
this:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}

In this example, the variable named ‘first’ will get the value ‘1’
because that is the value at index ‘[0]’ in the array.  The variable
named ‘second’ will get the value ‘2’ from index ‘[1]’ in the array.
Invalid Array Element Access Let's see what happens if you try to access
an element of an array that is past the end of the array.  Say you run
this code, similar to the guessing game in Chapter 2, to get an array
index from the user:

Filename: src/main.rs

use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
}

This code compiles successfully.  If you run this code using ‘cargo run’
and enter ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, or ‘4’, the program will print out the
corresponding value at that index in the array.  If you instead enter a
number past the end of the array, such as ‘10’, you'll see output like
this:

thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:19:19:
index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

The program resulted in a ‘runtime’ error at the point of using an
invalid value in the indexing operation.  The program exited with an
error message and didn't execute the final ‘println!’ statement.  When
you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that
the index you've specified is less than the array length.  If the index
is greater than or equal to the length, Rust will panic.  This check has
to happen at runtime, especially in this case, because the compiler
can't possibly know what value a user will enter when they run the code
later.

This is an example of Rust's memory safety principles in action.  In
many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you
provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed.  Rust
protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead
of allowing the memory access and continuing.  Chapter 9 discusses more
of Rust's error handling and how you can write readable, safe code that
neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.

6.4 Functions
=============

Functions are prevalent in Rust code.  You've already seen one of the
most important functions in the language: the ‘main’ function, which is
the entry point of many programs.  You've also seen the ‘fn’ keyword,
which allows you to declare new functions.

Rust code uses ‘snake case’ as the conventional style for function and
variable names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores
separate words.  Here's a program that contains an example function
definition:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}

We define a function in Rust by entering ‘fn’ followed by a function
name and a set of parentheses.  The curly brackets tell the compiler
where the function body begins and ends.

We can call any function we've defined by entering its name followed by
a set of parentheses.  Because ‘another_function’ is defined in the
program, it can be called from inside the ‘main’ function.  Note that we
defined ‘another_function’ ‘after’ the ‘main’ function in the source
code; we could have defined it before as well.  Rust doesn't care where
you define your functions, only that they're defined somewhere in a
scope that can be seen by the caller.

Let's start a new binary project named ‘functions’ to explore functions
further.  Place the ‘another_function’ example in ‘src/main.rs’ and run
it.  You should see the following output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
Hello, world!
Another function.

The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the ‘main’
function.  First the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then
‘another_function’ is called and its message is printed.

* Menu:

* Parameters::
* Statements and Expressions::
* Functions with Return Values::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Parameters,  Next: Statements and Expressions,  Prev: Functions,  Up: Functions

6.4.1 Parameters
----------------

We can define functions to have ‘parameters’, which are special
variables that are part of a function's signature.  When a function has
parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those
parameters.  Technically, the concrete values are called ‘arguments’,
but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words ‘parameter’ and
‘argument’ interchangeably for either the variables in a function's
definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.

In this version of ‘another_function’ we add a parameter:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

Try running this program; you should get the following output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5

The declaration of ‘another_function’ has one parameter named ‘x’.  The
type of ‘x’ is specified as ‘i32’.  When we pass ‘5’ in to
‘another_function’, the ‘println!’ macro puts ‘5’ where the pair of
curly brackets containing ‘x’ was in the format string.

In function signatures, you ‘must’ declare the type of each parameter.
This is a deliberate decision in Rust's design: requiring type
annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never
needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you
mean.  The compiler is also able to give more helpful error messages if
it knows what types the function expects.

When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations
with commas, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}

This example creates a function named ‘print_labeled_measurement’ with
two parameters.  The first parameter is named ‘value’ and is an ‘i32’.
The second is named ‘unit_label’ and is type ‘char’.  The function then
prints text containing both the ‘value’ and the ‘unit_label’.

Let's try running this code.  Replace the program currently in your
‘functions’ project's ‘src/main.rs’ file with the preceding example and
run it using ‘cargo run’:

$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The measurement is: 5h

Because we called the function with ‘5’ as the value for ‘value’ and
‘'h'’ as the value for ‘unit_label’, the program output contains those
values.

6.4.2 Statements and Expressions
--------------------------------

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending
in an expression.  So far, the functions we've covered haven't included
an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a
statement.  Because Rust is an expression-based language, this is an
important distinction to understand.  Other languages don't have the
same distinctions, so let's look at what statements and expressions are
and how their differences affect the bodies of functions.

   • *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not
     return a value.
   • *Expressions* evaluate to a resultant value.  Let's look at some
     examples.

We've actually already used statements and expressions.  Creating a
variable and assigning a value to it with the ‘let’ keyword is a
statement.  In Listing 3-1, ‘let y = 6;’ is a statement.

fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}

Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example
is a statement in itself.  (As we will see below, ‘calling’ a function
is not a statement.)

Statements do not return values.  Therefore, you can't assign a ‘let’
statement to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you'll
get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}

When you run this program, the error you'll get looks like this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)

The ‘let y = 6’ statement does not return a value, so there isn't
anything for ‘x’ to bind to.  This is different from what happens in
other languages, such as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the
value of the assignment.  In those languages, you can write ‘x = y = 6’
and have both ‘x’ and ‘y’ have the value ‘6’; that is not the case in
Rust.

Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code
that you'll write in Rust.  Consider a math operation, such as ‘5 + 6’,
which is an expression that evaluates to the value ‘11’.  Expressions
can be part of statements: in Listing 3-1, the ‘6’ in the statement ‘let
y = 6;’ is an expression that evaluates to the value ‘6’.  Calling a
function is an expression.  Calling a macro is an expression.  A new
scope block created with curly brackets is an expression, for example:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}

This expression:

{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}

is a block that, in this case, evaluates to ‘4’.  That value gets bound
to ‘y’ as part of the ‘let’ statement.  Note that the ‘x + 1’ line
doesn't have a semicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines
you've seen so far.  Expressions do not include ending semicolons.  If
you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a
statement, and it will then not return a value.  Keep this in mind as
you explore function return values and expressions next.

6.4.3 Functions with Return Values
----------------------------------

Functions can return values to the code that calls them.  We don't name
return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (‘->’).  In
Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of
the final expression in the block of the body of a function.  You can
return early from a function by using the ‘return’ keyword and
specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression
implicitly.  Here's an example of a function that returns a value:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

There are no function calls, macros, or even ‘let’ statements in the
‘five’ function--just the number ‘5’ by itself.  That's a perfectly
valid function in Rust.  Note that the function's return type is
specified too, as ‘-> i32’.  Try running this code; the output should
look like this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5

The ‘5’ in ‘five’ is the function's return value, which is why the
return type is ‘i32’.  Let's examine this in more detail.  There are two
important bits: first, the line ‘let x = five();’ shows that we're using
the return value of a function to initialize a variable.  Because the
function ‘five’ returns a ‘5’, that line is the same as the following:

let x = 5;

Second, the ‘five’ function has no parameters and defines the type of
the return value, but the body of the function is a lonely ‘5’ with no
semicolon because it's an expression whose value we want to return.

Let's look at another example:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

Running this code will print ‘The value of x is: 6’.  But if we place a
semicolon at the end of the line containing ‘x + 1’, changing it from an
expression to a statement, we'll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}

Compiling this code produces an error, as follows:

$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:24
  |

8 |     x + 1;
  |          - help: remove this semicolon to return this value

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `functions` (bin "functions") due to 1 previous error

The main error message, ‘mismatched types’, reveals the core issue with
this code.  The definition of the function ‘plus_one’ says that it will
return an ‘i32’, but statements don't evaluate to a value, which is
expressed by ‘()’, the unit type.  Therefore, nothing is returned, which
contradicts the function definition and results in an error.  In this
output, Rust provides a message to possibly help rectify this issue: it
suggests removing the semicolon, which would fix the error.

6.5 Comments
============

All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but
sometimes extra explanation is warranted.  In these cases, programmers
leave ‘comments’ in their source code that the compiler will ignore but
people reading the source code may find useful.

Here's a simple comment:

// hello, world

In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes,
and the comment continues until the end of the line.  For comments that
extend beyond a single line, you'll need to include ‘//’ on each line,
like this:

// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.

Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I’m feeling lucky today
}

But you'll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on
a separate line above the code it's annotating:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    // I’m feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}

Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which
we'll discuss in the *note “Publishing a Crate to Cratesio”: Publishing
a Crate to Cratesio. section of Chapter 14.

6.6 Control Flow
================

The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is ‘true’
and to run some code repeatedly while a condition is ‘true’ are basic
building blocks in most programming languages.  The most common
constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are
‘if’ expressions and loops.

* Menu:

* if Expressions::
* Repetition with Loops::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: if Expressions,  Next: Repetition with Loops,  Prev: Control Flow,  Up: Control Flow

6.6.1 ‘if’ Expressions
----------------------

An ‘if’ expression allows you to branch your code depending on
conditions.  You provide a condition and then state, “If this condition
is met, run this block of code.  If the condition is not met, do not run
this block of code.”

Create a new project called ‘branches’ in your ‘projects’ directory to
explore the ‘if’ expression.  In the ‘src/main.rs’ file, input the
following:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}

All ‘if’ expressions start with the keyword ‘if’, followed by a
condition.  In this case, the condition checks whether or not the
variable ‘number’ has a value less than 5.  We place the block of code
to execute if the condition is ‘true’ immediately after the condition
inside curly brackets.  Blocks of code associated with the conditions in
‘if’ expressions are sometimes called ‘arms’, just like the arms in
‘match’ expressions that we discussed in the *note “Comparing the Guess
to the Secret Number”: Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number. section
of Chapter 2.

Optionally, we can also include an ‘else’ expression, which we chose to
do here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute
should the condition evaluate to ‘false’.  If you don't provide an
‘else’ expression and the condition is ‘false’, the program will just
skip the ‘if’ block and move on to the next bit of code.

Try running this code; you should see the following output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was true

Let's try changing the value of ‘number’ to a value that makes the
condition ‘false’ to see what happens:

    let number = 7;

Run the program again, and look at the output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was false

It's also worth noting that the condition in this code ‘must’ be a
‘bool’.  If the condition isn't a ‘bool’, we'll get an error.  For
example, try running the following code:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}

The ‘if’ condition evaluates to a value of ‘3’ this time, and Rust
throws an error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:4:8
  |
4 |     if number {
  |        ^^^^^^ expected `bool`, found integer

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `branches` (bin "branches") due to 1 previous error

The error indicates that Rust expected a ‘bool’ but got an integer.
Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not
automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean.  You must
be explicit and always provide ‘if’ with a Boolean as its condition.  If
we want the ‘if’ code block to run only when a number is not equal to
‘0’, for example, we can change the ‘if’ expression to the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!("number was something other than zero");
    }
}

Running this code will print ‘number was something other than zero’.
Handling Multiple Conditions with ‘else if’ You can use multiple
conditions by combining ‘if’ and ‘else’ in an ‘else if’ expression.  For
example:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}

This program has four possible paths it can take.  After running it, you
should see the following output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
number is divisible by 3

When this program executes, it checks each ‘if’ expression in turn and
executes the first body for which the condition evaluates to ‘true’.
Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don't see the output
‘number is divisible by 2’, nor do we see the ‘number is not divisible
by 4, 3, or 2’ text from the ‘else’ block.  That's because Rust only
executes the block for the first ‘true’ condition, and once it finds
one, it doesn't even check the rest.

Using too many ‘else if’ expressions can clutter your code, so if you
have more than one, you might want to refactor your code.  Chapter 6
describes a powerful Rust branching construct called ‘match’ for these
cases.  Using ‘if’ in a ‘let’ Statement Because ‘if’ is an expression,
we can use it on the right side of a ‘let’ statement to assign the
outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.

fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}

The ‘number’ variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of
the ‘if’ expression.  Run this code to see what happens:

$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
The value of number is: 5

Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them,
and numbers by themselves are also expressions.  In this case, the value
of the whole ‘if’ expression depends on which block of code executes.
This means the values that have the potential to be results from each
arm of the ‘if’ must be the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of
both the ‘if’ arm and the ‘else’ arm were ‘i32’ integers.  If the types
are mismatched, as in the following example, we'll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}

When we try to compile this code, we'll get an error.  The ‘if’ and
‘else’ arms have value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates
exactly where to find the problem in the program:

$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: `if` and `else` have incompatible types
 --> src/main.rs:4:44
  |
4 |     let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
  |                                 -          ^^^^^ expected integer, found `&str`
  |                                 |
  |                                 expected because of this

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `branches` (bin "branches") due to 1 previous error

The expression in the ‘if’ block evaluates to an integer, and the
expression in the ‘else’ block evaluates to a string.  This won't work
because variables must have a single type, and Rust needs to know at
compile time what type the ‘number’ variable is, definitively.  Knowing
the type of ‘number’ lets the compiler verify the type is valid
everywhere we use ‘number’.  Rust wouldn't be able to do that if the
type of ‘number’ was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be
more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to
keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Repetition with Loops,  Next: Summary 3,  Prev: if Expressions,  Up: Control Flow

6.6.2 Repetition with Loops
---------------------------

It's often useful to execute a block of code more than once.  For this
task, Rust provides several ‘loops’, which will run through the code
inside the loop body to the end and then start immediately back at the
beginning.  To experiment with loops, let's make a new project called
‘loops’.

Rust has three kinds of loops: ‘loop’, ‘while’, and ‘for’.  Let's try
each one.  Repeating Code with ‘loop’ The ‘loop’ keyword tells Rust to
execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you
explicitly tell it to stop.

As an example, change the ‘src/main.rs’ file in your ‘loops’ directory
to look like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}

When we run this program, we'll see ‘again!’ printed over and over
continuously until we stop the program manually.  Most terminals support
the keyboard shortcut ctrl-c to interrupt a program that is stuck in a
continual loop.  Give it a try:

$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target/debug/loops`
again!
again!
again!
again!
^Cagain!

The symbol ‘^C’ represents where you pressed ctrl-c.  You may or may not
see the word ‘again!’ printed after the ‘^C’, depending on where the
code was in the loop when it received the interrupt signal.

Fortunately, Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code.
You can place the ‘break’ keyword within the loop to tell the program
when to stop executing the loop.  Recall that we did this in the
guessing game in the *note “Quitting After a Correct Guess”: Quitting
After a Correct Guess. section of Chapter 2 to exit the program when the
user won the game by guessing the correct number.

We also used ‘continue’ in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the
program to skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop
and go to the next iteration.  Returning Values from Loops One of the
uses of a ‘loop’ is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as
checking whether a thread has completed its job.  You might also need to
pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your
code.  To do this, you can add the value you want returned after the
‘break’ expression you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned
out of the loop so you can use it, as shown here:

fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}

Before the loop, we declare a variable named ‘counter’ and initialize it
to ‘0’.  Then we declare a variable named ‘result’ to hold the value
returned from the loop.  On every iteration of the loop, we add ‘1’ to
the ‘counter’ variable, and then check whether the ‘counter’ is equal to
‘10’.  When it is, we use the ‘break’ keyword with the value ‘counter *
2’.  After the loop, we use a semicolon to end the statement that
assigns the value to ‘result’.  Finally, we print the value in ‘result’,
which in this case is ‘20’.

You can also ‘return’ from inside a loop.  While ‘break’ only exits the
current loop, ‘return’ always exits the current function.  Loop Labels
to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops If you have loops within loops,
‘break’ and ‘continue’ apply to the innermost loop at that point.  You
can optionally specify a ‘loop label’ on a loop that you can then use
with ‘break’ or ‘continue’ to specify that those keywords apply to the
labeled loop instead of the innermost loop.  Loop labels must begin with
a single quote.  Here's an example with two nested loops:

fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}

The outer loop has the label ‘'counting_up’, and it will count up from 0
to 2.  The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9.  The
first ‘break’ that doesn't specify a label will exit the inner loop
only.  The ‘break 'counting_up;’ statement will exit the outer loop.
This code prints:

$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.58s
     Running `target/debug/loops`
count = 0
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 1
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 2
remaining = 10
End count = 2

Conditional Loops with ‘while’ A program will often need to evaluate a
condition within a loop.  While the condition is ‘true’, the loop runs.
When the condition ceases to be ‘true’, the program calls ‘break’,
stopping the loop.  It's possible to implement behavior like this using
a combination of ‘loop’, ‘if’, ‘else’, and ‘break’; you could try that
now in a program, if you'd like.  However, this pattern is so common
that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a ‘while’
loop.  In Listing 3-3, we use ‘while’ to loop the program three times,
counting down each time, and then, after the loop, print a message and
exit.

fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}

This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if
you used ‘loop’, ‘if’, ‘else’, and ‘break’, and it's clearer.  While a
condition evaluates to ‘true’, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the
loop.  Looping Through a Collection with ‘for’ You can also use the
‘while’ construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an
array.  For example, the loop in Listing 3-4 prints each element in the
array ‘a’.

fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}

Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array.  It starts
at index ‘0’, and then loops until it reaches the final index in the
array (that is, when ‘index < 5’ is no longer ‘true’).  Running this
code will print every element in the array:

$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32s
     Running `target/debug/loops`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20
the value is: 30
the value is: 40
the value is: 50

All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected.  Even though
‘index’ will reach a value of ‘5’ at some point, the loop stops
executing before trying to fetch a sixth value from the array.

However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to
panic if the index value or test condition is incorrect.  For example,
if you changed the definition of the ‘a’ array to have four elements but
forgot to update the condition to ‘while index < 4’, the code would
panic.  It's also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code to
perform the conditional check of whether the index is within the bounds
of the array on every iteration through the loop.

As a more concise alternative, you can use a ‘for’ loop and execute some
code for each item in a collection.  A ‘for’ loop looks like the code in
Listing 3-5.

fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}

When we run this code, we'll see the same output as in Listing 3-4.
More importantly, we've now increased the safety of the code and
eliminated the chance of bugs that might result from going beyond the
end of the array or not going far enough and missing some items.

Using the ‘for’ loop, you wouldn't need to remember to change any other
code if you changed the number of values in the array, as you would with
the method used in Listing 3-4.

The safety and conciseness of ‘for’ loops make them the most commonly
used loop construct in Rust.  Even in situations in which you want to
run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example
that used a ‘while’ loop in Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a
‘for’ loop.  The way to do that would be to use a ‘Range’, provided by
the standard library, which generates all numbers in sequence starting
from one number and ending before another number.

Here's what the countdown would look like using a ‘for’ loop and another
method we've not yet talked about, ‘rev’, to reverse the range:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}

This code is a bit nicer, isn't it?

7 Understanding Ownership
*************************

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature and has deep implications for
the rest of the language.  It enables Rust to make memory safety
guarantees without needing a garbage collector, so it's important to
understand how ownership works.  In this chapter, we'll talk about
ownership as well as several related features: borrowing, slices, and
how Rust lays data out in memory.

7.1 What Is Ownership?
======================

‘Ownership’ is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages
memory.  All programs have to manage the way they use a computer's
memory while running.  Some languages have garbage collection that
regularly looks for no-longer-used memory as the program runs; in other
languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory.
Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed through a system of
ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.  If any of the
rules are violated, the program won't compile.  None of the features of
ownership will slow down your program while it's running.

Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take
some time to get used to.  The good news is that the more experienced
you become with Rust and the rules of the ownership system, the easier
you'll find it to naturally develop code that is safe and efficient.
Keep at it!

When you understand ownership, you'll have a solid foundation for
understanding the features that make Rust unique.  In this chapter,
you'll learn ownership by working through some examples that focus on a

7.1.1 The Stack and the Heap
----------------------------

Many programming languages don't require you to think about the stack
and the heap very often.  But in a systems programming language like
Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap affects how the
language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions.  Parts of
ownership will be described in relation to the stack and the heap later
in this chapter, so here is a brief explanation in preparation.

Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code
to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways.  The stack
stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the
opposite order.  This is referred to as ‘last in, first out’.  Think of
a stack of plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the
pile, and when you need a plate, you take one off the top.  Adding or
removing plates from the middle or bottom wouldn't work as well!  Adding
data is called ‘pushing onto the stack’, and removing data is called
‘popping off the stack’.  All data stored on the stack must have a
known, fixed size.  Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size
that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a
certain amount of space.  The memory allocator finds an empty spot in
the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a
‘pointer’, which is the address of that location.  This process is
called ‘allocating on the heap’ and is sometimes abbreviated as just
‘allocating’ (pushing values onto the stack is not considered
allocating).  Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size,
you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual
data, you must follow the pointer.  Think of being seated at a
restaurant.  When you enter, you state the number of people in your
group, and the host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads
you there.  If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where
you've been seated to find you.

Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the
allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that
location is always at the top of the stack.  Comparatively, allocating
space on the heap requires more work because the allocator must first
find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to
prepare for the next allocation.

Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack
because you have to follow a pointer to get there.  Contemporary
processors are faster if they jump around less in memory.  Continuing
the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many
tables.  It's most efficient to get all the orders at one table before
moving on to the next table.  Taking an order from table A, then an
order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B again
would be a much slower process.  By the same token, a processor can do
its job better if it works on data that's close to other data (as it is
on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap).

When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the
function's local variables get pushed onto the stack.  When the function
is over, those values get popped off the stack.

Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up
unused data on the heap so you don't run out of space are all problems
that ownership addresses.  Once you understand ownership, you won't need
to think about the stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the
main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data can help explain why it
works the way it does.

7.1.2 Ownership Rules
---------------------

First, let's take a look at the ownership rules.  Keep these rules in
mind as we work through the examples that illustrate them:

   • Each value in Rust has an ‘owner’.
   • There can only be one owner at a time.
   • When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

7.1.3 Variable Scope
--------------------

Now that we're past basic Rust syntax, we won't include all the ‘fn
main() {’ code in examples, so if you're following along, make sure to
put the following examples inside a ‘main’ function manually.  As a
result, our examples will be a bit more concise, letting us focus on the
actual details rather than boilerplate code.

As a first example of ownership, we'll look at the ‘scope’ of some
variables.  A scope is the range within a program for which an item is
valid.  Take the following variable:

let s = "hello";

The variable ‘s’ refers to a string literal, where the value of the
string is hardcoded into the text of our program.  The variable is valid
from the point at which it's declared until the end of the current
‘scope’.  Listing 4-1 shows a program with comments annotating where the
variable ‘s’ would be valid.

    {                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid

In other words, there are two important points in time here:

   • When ‘s’ comes ‘into’ scope, it is valid.
   • It remains valid until it goes ‘out of’ scope.

At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are
valid is similar to that in other programming languages.  Now we'll
build on top of this understanding by introducing the ‘String’ type.

7.1.4 The ‘String’ Type
-----------------------

To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more
complex than those we covered in the *note “Data Types”: Data Types.
section of Chapter 3.  The types covered previously are of a known size,
can be stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is
over, and can be quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent
instance if another part of code needs to use the same value in a
different scope.  But we want to look at data that is stored on the heap
and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data, and the ‘String’
type is a great example.

We'll concentrate on the parts of ‘String’ that relate to ownership.
These aspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are
provided by the standard library or created by you.  We'll discuss
‘String’ in more depth in *note Chapter 8: Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text
with Strings.

We've already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded
into our program.  String literals are convenient, but they aren't
suitable for every situation in which we may want to use text.  One
reason is that they're immutable.  Another is that not every string
value can be known when we write our code: for example, what if we want
to take user input and store it?  For these situations, Rust has a
second string type, ‘String’.  This type manages data allocated on the
heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to
us at compile time.  You can create a ‘String’ from a string literal
using the ‘from’ function, like so:

let s = String::from("hello");

The double colon ‘::’ operator allows us to namespace this particular
‘from’ function under the ‘String’ type rather than using some sort of
name like ‘string_from’.  We'll discuss this syntax more in the *note
“Method Syntax”: Method Syntax. section of Chapter 5, and when we talk
about namespacing with modules in *note “Paths for Referring to an Item
in the Module Tree”: Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree.
in Chapter 7.

This kind of string ‘can’ be mutated:

    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{s}"); // This will print `hello, world!`

So, what's the difference here?  Why can ‘String’ be mutated but
literals cannot?  The difference is in how these two types deal with
memory.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Memory and Allocation,  Next: Ownership and Functions,  Prev: The String Type,  Up: What Is Ownership?

7.1.5 Memory and Allocation
---------------------------

In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time,
so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable.  This is
why string literals are fast and efficient.  But these properties only
come from the string literal's immutability.  Unfortunately, we can't
put a blob of memory into the binary for each piece of text whose size
is unknown at compile time and whose size might change while running the
program.

With the ‘String’ type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of
text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at
compile time, to hold the contents.  This means:

   • The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
   • We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we're
     done with our ‘String’.

That first part is done by us: when we call ‘String::from’, its
implementation requests the memory it needs.  This is pretty much
universal in programming languages.

However, the second part is different.  In languages with a ‘garbage
collector (GC)’, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn't
being used anymore, and we don't need to think about it.  In most
languages without a GC, it's our responsibility to identify when memory
is no longer being used and to call code to explicitly free it, just as
we did to request it.  Doing this correctly has historically been a
difficult programming problem.  If we forget, we'll waste memory.  If we
do it too early, we'll have an invalid variable.  If we do it twice,
that's a bug too.  We need to pair exactly one ‘allocate’ with exactly
one ‘free’.

Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once
the variable that owns it goes out of scope.  Here's a version of our
scope example from Listing 4-1 using a ‘String’ instead of a string
literal:

    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid

There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our ‘String’
needs to the allocator: when ‘s’ goes out of scope.  When a variable
goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us.  This function
is called ‘drop’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/ops/trait.Drop.html), and it's
where the author of ‘String’ can put the code to return the memory.
Rust calls ‘drop’ automatically at the closing curly bracket.

Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an
item's lifetime is sometimes called ‘Resource Acquisition Is
Initialization (RAII)’.  The ‘drop’ function in Rust will be familiar to
you if you've used RAII patterns.

This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written.  It
may seem simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in
more complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use
the data we've allocated on the heap.  Let's explore some of those
situations now.  Variables and Data Interacting with Move Multiple
variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.
Let's look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.

    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value ‘5’ to ‘x’;
then make a copy of the value in ‘x’ and bind it to ‘y’.” We now have
two variables, ‘x’ and ‘y’, and both equal ‘5’.  This is indeed what is
happening, because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size,
and these two ‘5’ values are pushed onto the stack.

Now let's look at the ‘String’ version:

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would
be the same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in
‘s1’ and bind it to ‘s2’.  But this isn't quite what happens.

Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to ‘String’ under the
covers.  A ‘String’ is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a
pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length,
and a capacity.  This group of data is stored on the stack.  On the
right is the memory on the heap that holds the contents.

        stack
      +-------------------+
   s1 | ptr               +-----------+     heap
      | len          5    |           |   +--------+-------+
      | capacity     5    |           |   | index  | value |
      +-------------------+           +-->|   0    |   h   |
                                          |   1    |   e   |
                                          |   2    |   l   |
                                          |   3    |   l   |
                                          |   4    |   o   |
                                          +--------+-------+

Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a ‘String’ holding the value
‘"hello"’ bound to ‘s1’

The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the ‘String’
are currently using.  The capacity is the total amount of memory, in
bytes, that the ‘String’ has received from the allocator.  The
difference between length and capacity matters, but not in this context,
so for now, it's fine to ignore the capacity.

When we assign ‘s1’ to ‘s2’, the ‘String’ data is copied, meaning we
copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack.
We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.  In
other words, the data representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.

      +-------------------+

Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable ‘s2’ that has a
copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of ‘s1’

The representation does ‘not’ look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory
would look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well.  If Rust
did this, the operation ‘s2 = s1’ could be very expensive in terms of
runtime performance if the data on the heap were large.

                                          +--------+-------+

Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what ‘s2 = s1’ might do if Rust
copied the heap data as well

Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust
automatically calls the ‘drop’ function and cleans up the heap memory
for that variable.  But Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to
the same location.  This is a problem: when ‘s2’ and ‘s1’ go out of
scope, they will both try to free the same memory.  This is known as a
‘double free’ error and is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned
previously.  Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which
can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

To ensure memory safety, after the line ‘let s2 = s1;’, Rust considers
‘s1’ as no longer valid.  Therefore, Rust doesn't need to free anything
when ‘s1’ goes out of scope.  Check out what happens when you try to use
‘s1’ after ‘s2’ is created; it won't work:

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    println!("{s1}, world!");

You'll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the
invalidated reference:

$ cargo run

If you've heard the terms ‘shallow copy’ and ‘deep copy’ while working
with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and
capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow
copy.  But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of
being called a shallow copy, it's known as a ‘move’.  In this example,
we would say that ‘s1’ was ‘moved’ into ‘s2’.  So, what actually happens
is shown in Figure 4-4.

      +-------------------+

Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after ‘s1’ has been invalidated

That solves our problem!  With only ‘s2’ valid, when it goes out of
scope it alone will free the memory, and we're done.

In addition, there's a design choice that's implied by this: Rust will
never automatically create “deep” copies of your data.  Therefore, any
‘automatic’ copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime
performance.  Scope and Assignment The inverse of this is true for the
relationship between scoping, ownership, and memory being freed via the
‘drop’ function as well.  When you assign a completely new value to an
existing variable, Rust will call ‘drop’ and free the original value's
memory immediately.  Consider this code, for example:

    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    s = String::from("ahoy");

    println!("{s}, world!");

We initially declare a variable ‘s’ and bind it to a ‘String’ with the
value ‘"hello"’.  Then we immediately create a new ‘String’ with the
value ‘"ahoy"’ and assign it to ‘s’.  At this point, nothing is
referring to the original value on the heap at all.

replaced in its entirety.

The original string thus immediately goes out of scope.  Rust will run
the ‘drop’ function on it and its memory will be freed right away.  When
we print the value at the end, it will be ‘"ahoy, world!"’.  Variables
and Data Interacting with Clone If we ‘do’ want to deeply copy the heap
data of the ‘String’, not just the stack data, we can use a common
method called ‘clone’.  We'll discuss method syntax in Chapter 5, but
because methods are a common feature in many programming languages,
you've probably seen them before.

Here's an example of the ‘clone’ method in action:

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");

This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in
Figure 4-3, where the heap data ‘does’ get copied.

When you see a call to ‘clone’, you know that some arbitrary code is
being executed and that code may be expensive.  It's a visual indicator
that something different is going on.  Stack-Only Data: Copy There's
another wrinkle we haven't talked about yet.  This code using
integers--part of which was shown in Listing 4-2--works and is valid:

    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {x}, y = {y}");

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don't have a
call to ‘clone’, but ‘x’ is still valid and wasn't moved into ‘y’.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at
compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual
values are quick to make.  That means there's no reason we would want to
prevent ‘x’ from being valid after we create the variable ‘y’.  In other
words, there's no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so
calling ‘clone’ wouldn't do anything different from the usual shallow
copying, and we can leave it out.

Rust has a special annotation called the ‘Copy’ trait that we can place
on types that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we'll talk more
about traits in *note Chapter 10: Traits Defining Shared Behavior.).  If
a type implements the ‘Copy’ trait, variables that use it do not move,
but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after
assignment to another variable.

Rust won't let us annotate a type with ‘Copy’ if the type, or any of its
parts, has implemented the ‘Drop’ trait.  If the type needs something
special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the ‘Copy’
annotation to that type, we'll get a compile-time error.  To learn about
how to add the ‘Copy’ annotation to your type to implement the trait,
see *note “Derivable Traits”: Appendix C Derivable Traits. in Appendix
C.

So, what types implement the ‘Copy’ trait?  You can check the
documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any
group of simple scalar values can implement ‘Copy’, and nothing that
requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement ‘Copy’.
Here are some of the types that implement ‘Copy’:

   • All the integer types, such as ‘u32’.
   • The Boolean type, ‘bool’, with values ‘true’ and ‘false’.
   • All the floating-point types, such as ‘f64’.
   • The character type, ‘char’.
   • Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement ‘Copy’.  For
     example, ‘(i32, i32)’ implements ‘Copy’, but ‘(i32, String)’ does
     not.

7.1.6 Ownership and Functions
-----------------------------

The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when
assigning a value to a variable.  Passing a variable to a function will
move or copy, just as assignment does.  Listing 4-3 has an example with
some annotations showing where variables go into and out of scope.

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // because i32 implements the Copy trait,
                                    // x does NOT move into the function,
    println!("{}", x);              // so it's okay to use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.

If we tried to use ‘s’ after the call to ‘takes_ownership’, Rust would
throw a compile-time error.  These static checks protect us from
mistakes.  Try adding code to ‘main’ that uses ‘s’ and ‘x’ to see where
you can use them and where the ownership rules prevent you from doing
so.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Return Values and Scope,  Next: References and Borrowing,  Prev: Ownership and Functions,  Up: What Is Ownership?

7.1.7 Return Values and Scope
-----------------------------

Returning values can also transfer ownership.  Listing 4-4 shows an
example of a function that returns some value, with similar annotations
as those in Listing 4-3.

fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}

The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time:
assigning a value to another variable moves it.  When a variable that
includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned
up by ‘drop’ unless ownership of the data has been moved to another
variable.

While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with
every function is a bit tedious.  What if we want to let a function use
a value but not take ownership?  It's quite annoying that anything we
pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in
addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we
might want to return as well.

Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in
Listing 4-5.

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{s2}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that
should be common.  Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value
without transferring ownership, called ‘references’.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: References and Borrowing,  Next: The Slice Type,  Prev: What Is Ownership?,  Up: Understanding Ownership

7.2 References and Borrowing
============================

The issue with the tuple code in Listing 4-5 is that we have to return
the ‘String’ to the calling function so we can still use the ‘String’
after the call to ‘calculate_length’, because the ‘String’ was moved
into ‘calculate_length’.  Instead, we can provide a reference to the
‘String’ value.  A ‘reference’ is like a pointer in that it's an address
we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is
owned by some other variable.  Unlike a pointer, a reference is
guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life
of that reference.

Here is how you would define and use a ‘calculate_length’ function that
has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership
of the value:

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and
the function return value is gone.  Second, note that we pass ‘&s1’ into
‘calculate_length’ and, in its definition, we take ‘&String’ rather than
‘String’.  These ampersands represent ‘references’, and they allow you
to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.  Figure 4-6
depicts this concept.

                                                    heap

Figure 4-6: A diagram of ‘&String s’ pointing at ‘String s1’

Note: The opposite of referencing by using ‘&’ is ‘dereferencing’, which
is accomplished with the dereference operator, ‘*’.  We'll see some uses
of the dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of
dereferencing in Chapter 15.

Let's take a closer look at the function call here:

    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

The ‘&s1’ syntax lets us create a reference that ‘refers’ to the value
of ‘s1’ but does not own it.  Because the reference does not own it, the
value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being
used.

Likewise, the signature of the function uses ‘&’ to indicate that the
type of the parameter ‘s’ is a reference.  Let's add some explanatory
annotations:

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because s does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, the value is not dropped.

The scope in which the variable ‘s’ is valid is the same as any function
parameter's scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not
dropped when ‘s’ stops being used, because ‘s’ doesn't have ownership.
When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual
values, we won't need to return the values in order to give back
ownership, because we never had ownership.

We call the action of creating a reference ‘borrowing’.  As in real
life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them.  When
you're done, you have to give it back.  You don't own it.

So, what happens if we try to modify something we're borrowing?  Try the
code in Listing 4-6.  Spoiler alert: it doesn't work!

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

Here's the error:

Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references.  We're
not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.

7.2.1 Mutable References
------------------------

We can fix the code from Listing 4-6 to allow us to modify a borrowed
value with just a few small tweaks that use, instead, a ‘mutable
reference’:

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

First we change ‘s’ to be ‘mut’.  Then we create a mutable reference
with ‘&mut s’ where we call the ‘change’ function, and update the
function signature to accept a mutable reference with ‘some_string: &mut
String’.  This makes it very clear that the ‘change’ function will
mutate the value it borrows.

Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable
reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value.
This code that attempts to create two mutable references to ‘s’ will
fail:

    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

Here's the error:

error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error

This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow ‘s’
as mutable more than once at a time.  The first mutable borrow is in
‘r1’ and must last until it's used in the ‘println!’, but between the
creation of that mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create
another mutable reference in ‘r2’ that borrows the same data as ‘r1’.

The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data
at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion.
It's something that new Rustaceans struggle with because most languages
let you mutate whenever you'd like.  The benefit of having this
restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time.  A
‘data race’ is similar to a race condition and happens when these three
behaviors occur:

   • Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
   • At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
   • There's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and
fix when you're trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this
problem by refusing to compile code with data races!

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for
multiple mutable references, just not ‘simultaneous’ ones:

    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;

Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable
references.  This code results in an error:

    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);

error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error

Whew!  We ‘also’ cannot have a mutable reference while we have an
immutable one to the same value.

Users of an immutable reference don't expect the value to suddenly
change out from under them!  However, multiple immutable references are
allowed because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to
affect anyone else's reading of the data.

Note that a reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and
continues through the last time that reference is used.  For instance,
this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable
references, the ‘println!’, occurs before the mutable reference is
introduced:

    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{r1} and {r2}");
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{r3}");

The scopes of the immutable references ‘r1’ and ‘r2’ end after the
‘println!’ where they are last used, which is before the mutable
reference ‘r3’ is created.  These scopes don't overlap, so this code is
allowed: the compiler can tell that the reference is no longer being
used at a point before the end of the scope.

Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that
it's the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile
time rather than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem
is.  Then you don't have to track down why your data isn't what you
thought it was.

7.2.2 Dangling References
-------------------------

In languages with pointers, it's easy to erroneously create a ‘dangling
pointer’--a pointer that references a location in memory that may have
been given to someone else--by freeing some memory while preserving a
pointer to that memory.  In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees
that references will never be dangling references: if you have a
reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not
go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

Let's try to create a dangling reference to see how Rust prevents them
with a compile-time error:

fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}

Here's the error:

error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 2 previous errors

This error message refers to a feature we haven't covered yet:
lifetimes.  We'll discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter 10.  But, if
you disregard the parts about lifetimes, the message does contain the
key to why this code is a problem:

this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value
for it to be borrowed from

Let's take a closer look at exactly what's happening at each stage of
our ‘dangle’ code:

fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!

Because ‘s’ is created inside ‘dangle’, when the code of ‘dangle’ is
finished, ‘s’ will be deallocated.  But we tried to return a reference
to it.  That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid
‘String’.  That's no good!  Rust won't let us do this.

The solution here is to return the ‘String’ directly:

fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}

This works without any problems.  Ownership is moved out, and nothing is
deallocated.

7.2.3 The Rules of References
-----------------------------

Let's recap what we've discussed about references:

   • At any given time, you can have ‘either’ one mutable reference ‘or’
     any number of immutable references.
   • References must always be valid.

Next, we'll look at a different kind of reference: slices.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: The Slice Type,  Next: Summary 4,  Prev: References and Borrowing,  Up: Understanding Ownership

7.3 The Slice Type
==================

‘Slices’ let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a *note
collection: Common Collections. rather than the whole collection.  A
slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

Here's a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string
of words separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that
string.  If the function doesn't find a space in the string, the whole
string must be one word, so the entire string should be returned.

Let's work through how we'd write the signature of this function without
using slices, to understand the problem that slices will solve:

fn first_word(s: &String) -> ?

The ‘first_word’ function has a ‘&String’ as a parameter.  We don't want
ownership, so this is fine.  But what should we return?  We don't really
have a way to talk about ‘part’ of a string.  However, we could return
the index of the end of the word, indicated by a space.  Let's try that,
as shown in Listing 4-7.

fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}

Because we need to go through the ‘String’ element by element and check
whether a value is a space, we'll convert our ‘String’ to an array of
bytes using the ‘as_bytes’ method.

    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the ‘iter’
method:

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {

We'll discuss iterators in more detail in *note Chapter 13: Processing a
Series of Items with Iterators.  For now, know that ‘iter’ is a method
that returns each element in a collection and that ‘enumerate’ wraps the
result of ‘iter’ and returns each element as part of a tuple instead.
The first element of the tuple returned from ‘enumerate’ is the index,
and the second element is a reference to the element.  This is a bit
more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.

Because the ‘enumerate’ method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to
destructure that tuple.  We'll be discussing patterns more in *note
Chapter 6: Patterns That Bind to Values.  In the ‘for’ loop, we specify
a pattern that has ‘i’ for the index in the tuple and ‘&item’ for the
single byte in the tuple.  Because we get a reference to the element
from ‘.iter().enumerate()’, we use ‘&’ in the pattern.

Inside the ‘for’ loop, we search for the byte that represents the space
by using the byte literal syntax.  If we find a space, we return the
position.  Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using
‘s.len()’.

        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()

We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in
the string, but there's a problem.  We're returning a ‘usize’ on its
own, but it's only a meaningful number in the context of the ‘&String’.
In other words, because it's a separate value from the ‘String’, there's
no guarantee that it will still be valid in the future.  Consider the
program in Listing 4-8 that uses the ‘first_word’ function from Listing
4-7.

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5

    s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
}

This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used
‘word’ after calling ‘s.clear()’.  Because ‘word’ isn't connected to the
state of ‘s’ at all, ‘word’ still contains the value ‘5’.  We could use
that value ‘5’ with the variable ‘s’ to try to extract the first word
out, but this would be a bug because the contents of ‘s’ have changed
since we saved ‘5’ in ‘word’.

Having to worry about the index in ‘word’ getting out of sync with the
data in ‘s’ is tedious and error prone!  Managing these indices is even
more brittle if we write a ‘second_word’ function.  Its signature would
have to look like this:

fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {

Now we're tracking a starting ‘and’ an ending index, and we have even
more values that were calculated from data in a particular state but
aren't tied to that state at all.  We have three unrelated variables
floating around that need to be kept in sync.

Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.

7.3.1 String Slices
-------------------

A ‘string slice’ is a reference to part of a ‘String’, and it looks like
this:

    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];

Rather than a reference to the entire ‘String’, ‘hello’ is a reference
to a portion of the ‘String’, specified in the extra ‘[0..5]’ bit.  We
create slices using a range within brackets by specifying
‘[starting_index..ending_index]’, where ‘starting_index’ is the first
position in the slice and ‘ending_index’ is one more than the last
position in the slice.  Internally, the slice data structure stores the
starting position and the length of the slice, which corresponds to
‘ending_index’ minus ‘starting_index’.  So, in the case of ‘let world =
&s[6..11];’, ‘world’ would be a slice that contains a pointer to the
byte at index 6 of ‘s’ with a length value of ‘5’.

Figure 4-7 shows this in a diagram.

Figure 4-7: String slice referring to part of a ‘String’

With Rust's ‘..’ range syntax, if you want to start at index 0, you can
drop the value before the two periods.  In other words, these are equal:

let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];

By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the ‘String’,
you can drop the trailing number.  That means these are equal:

let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];

You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string.  So
these are equal:

let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];

Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character
boundaries.  If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a
multibyte character, your program will exit with an error.  For the
purposes of introducing string slices, we are assuming ASCII only in
this section; a more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the
*note “Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings”: Storing UTF-8 Encoded
Text with Strings. section of Chapter 8.

With all this information in mind, let's rewrite ‘first_word’ to return
a slice.  The type that signifies “string slice” is written as ‘&str’:

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}

We get the index for the end of the word the same way we did in Listing
4-7, by looking for the first occurrence of a space.  When we find a
space, we return a string slice using the start of the string and the
index of the space as the starting and ending indices.

Now when we call ‘first_word’, we get back a single value that is tied
to the underlying data.  The value is made up of a reference to the
starting point of the slice and the number of elements in the slice.

Returning a slice would also work for a ‘second_word’ function:

fn second_word(s: &String) -> &str {

We now have a straightforward API that's much harder to mess up because
the compiler will ensure the references into the ‘String’ remain valid.
Remember the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to
the end of the first word but then cleared the string so our index was
invalid?  That code was logically incorrect but didn't show any
immediate errors.  The problems would show up later if we kept trying to
use the first word index with an emptied string.  Slices make this bug
impossible and let us know we have a problem with our code much sooner.
Using the slice version of ‘first_word’ will throw a compile-time error:

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {word}");
}

Here's the compiler error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error

Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference
to something, we cannot also take a mutable reference.  Because ‘clear’
needs to truncate the ‘String’, it needs to get a mutable reference.
The ‘println!’ after the call to ‘clear’ uses the reference in ‘word’,
so the immutable reference must still be active at that point.  Rust
disallows the mutable reference in ‘clear’ and the immutable reference
in ‘word’ from existing at the same time, and compilation fails.  Not
only has Rust made our API easier to use, but it has also eliminated an
entire class of errors at compile time!  String Literals as Slices
Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the
binary.  Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand
string literals:

let s = "Hello, world!";

The type of ‘s’ here is ‘&str’: it's a slice pointing to that specific
point of the binary.  This is also why string literals are immutable;
‘&str’ is an immutable reference.  String Slices as Parameters Knowing
that you can take slices of literals and ‘String’ values leads us to one
more improvement on ‘first_word’, and that's its signature:

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {

A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing
4-9 instead because it allows us to use the same function on both
‘&String’ values and ‘&str’ values.

fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {

If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly.  If we have a
‘String’, we can pass a slice of the ‘String’ or a reference to the
‘String’.  This flexibility takes advantage of ‘deref coercions’, a
feature we will cover in the *note “Implicit Deref Coercions with
Functions and Methods”: Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and
Methods. section of Chapter 15.

Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a
‘String’ makes our API more general and useful without losing any
functionality:

fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
    // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
    // to whole slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}

7.3.2 Other Slices
------------------

String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings.  But
there's a more general slice type too.  Consider this array:

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Just as we might want to refer to part of a string, we might want to
refer to part of an array.  We'd do so like this:

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);

This slice has the type ‘&[i32]’.  It works the same way as string
slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length.
You'll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections.  We'll
discuss these collections in detail when we talk about vectors in
Chapter 8.

7.4 Summary
===========

The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in
Rust programs at compile time.  The Rust language gives you control over
your memory usage in the same way as other systems programming
languages, but having the owner of data automatically clean up that data
when the owner goes out of scope means you don't have to write and debug
extra code to get this control.

Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we'll talk
about these concepts further throughout the rest of the book.  Let's
move on to Chapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a
‘struct’.

8 Using Structs to Structure Related Data
*****************************************

A ‘struct’, or ‘structure’, is a custom data type that lets you package
together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful
group.  If you're familiar with an object-oriented language, a ‘struct’
is like an object's data attributes.  In this chapter, we'll compare and
contrast tuples with structs to build on what you already know and
demonstrate when structs are a better way to group data.

We'll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs.  We'll discuss
how to define associated functions, especially the kind of associated
functions called ‘methods’, to specify behavior associated with a struct
type.  Structs and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building
blocks for creating new types in your program's domain to take full
advantage of Rust's compile-time type checking.

8.1 Defining and Instantiating Structs
======================================

Structs are similar to tuples, discussed in *note “The Tuple Type”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch03-02-data-typesmd__the-tuple-type. section,
in that both hold multiple related values.  Like tuples, the pieces of a
struct can be different types.  Unlike with tuples, in a struct you'll
name each piece of data so it's clear what the values mean.  Adding
these names means that structs are more flexible than tuples: you don't
have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of
an instance.

To define a struct, we enter the keyword ‘struct’ and name the entire
struct.  A struct's name should describe the significance of the pieces
of data being grouped together.  Then, inside curly brackets, we define
the names and types of the pieces of data, which we call ‘fields’.  For
example, Listing 5-1 shows a struct that stores information about a user
account.

struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

To use a struct after we've defined it, we create an ‘instance’ of that
struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields.  We create
an instance by stating the name of the struct and then add curly
brackets containing ‘key: value’ pairs, where the keys are the names of
the fields and the values are the data we want to store in those fields.
We don't have to specify the fields in the same order in which we
declared them in the struct.  In other words, the struct definition is
like a general template for the type, and instances fill in that
template with particular data to create values of the type.  For
example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}

To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation.  For
example, to access this user's email address, we use ‘user1.email’.  If
the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation
and assigning into a particular field.  Listing 5-3 shows how to change
the value in the ‘email’ field of a mutable ‘User’ instance.

fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}

Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn't allow us to
mark only certain fields as mutable.  As with any expression, we can
construct a new instance of the struct as the last expression in the
function body to implicitly return that new instance.

Listing 5-4 shows a ‘build_user’ function that returns a ‘User’ instance
with the given email and username.  The ‘active’ field gets the value of
‘true’, and the ‘sign_in_count’ gets a value of ‘1’.

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username: username,
        email: email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

It makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the
struct fields, but having to repeat the ‘email’ and ‘username’ field
names and variables is a bit tedious.  If the struct had more fields,
repeating each name would get even more annoying.  Luckily, there's a
convenient shorthand!

8.1.1 Using the Field Init Shorthand
------------------------------------

Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the
same in Listing 5-4, we can use the ‘field init shorthand’ syntax to
rewrite ‘build_user’ so it behaves exactly the same but doesn't have the
repetition of ‘username’ and ‘email’, as shown in Listing 5-5.

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username,
        email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

Here, we're creating a new instance of the ‘User’ struct, which has a
field named ‘email’.  We want to set the ‘email’ field's value to the
value in the ‘email’ parameter of the ‘build_user’ function.  Because
the ‘email’ field and the ‘email’ parameter have the same name, we only
need to write ‘email’ rather than ‘email: email’.

8.1.1.1 Creating Instances from Other Instances with Struct
...........................................................

Update Syntax It's often useful to create a new instance of a struct
that includes most of the values from another instance, but changes
some.  You can do this using ‘struct update syntax’.

First, in Listing 5-6 we show how to create a new ‘User’ instance in
‘user2’ regularly, without the update syntax.  We set a new value for
‘email’ but otherwise use the same values from ‘user1’ that we created
in Listing 5-2.

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
}

Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less
code, as shown in Listing 5-7.  The syntax ‘..’ specifies that the
remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the
fields in the given instance.

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}

The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in ‘user2’ that has a
different value for ‘email’ but has the same values for the ‘username’,
‘active’, and ‘sign_in_count’ fields from ‘user1’.  The ‘..user1’ must
come last to specify that any remaining fields should get their values
from the corresponding fields in ‘user1’, but we can choose to specify
values for as many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the
order of the fields in the struct's definition.

Note that the struct update syntax uses ‘=’ like an assignment; this is
because it moves the data, just as we saw in the *note “Variables and
Data Interacting with Move”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch04-01-what-is-ownershipmd__variables-and-data-interacting-with-move.
section.  In this example, we can no longer use ‘user1’ as a whole after
creating ‘user2’ because the ‘String’ in the ‘username’ field of ‘user1’
was moved into ‘user2’.  If we had given ‘user2’ new ‘String’ values for
both ‘email’ and ‘username’, and thus only used the ‘active’ and
‘sign_in_count’ values from ‘user1’, then ‘user1’ would still be valid
after creating ‘user2’.  Both ‘active’ and ‘sign_in_count’ are types
that implement the ‘Copy’ trait, so the behavior we discussed in the
*note “Stack-Only Data Copy”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch04-01-what-is-ownershipmd__stack-only-data-copy.
section would apply.  We can still use ‘user1.email’ in this example,
since its value was ‘not’ moved out.

8.1.1.2 Using Tuple Structs Without Named Fields to Create
..........................................................

Different Types Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples,
called ‘tuple structs’.  Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct
name provides but don't have names associated with their fields; rather,
they just have the types of the fields.  Tuple structs are useful when
you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different
type from other tuples, and when naming each field as in a regular
struct would be verbose or redundant.

To define a tuple struct, start with the ‘struct’ keyword and the struct
name followed by the types in the tuple.  For example, here we define
and use two tuple structs named ‘Color’ and ‘Point’:

struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}

Note that the ‘black’ and ‘origin’ values are different types because
they're instances of different tuple structs.  Each struct you define is
its own type, even though the fields within the struct might have the
same types.  For example, a function that takes a parameter of type
‘Color’ cannot take a ‘Point’ as an argument, even though both types are
made up of three ‘i32’ values.  Otherwise, tuple struct instances are
similar to tuples in that you can destructure them into their individual
pieces, and you can use a ‘.’ followed by the index to access an
individual value.  Unlike tuples, tuple structs require you to name the
type of the struct when you destructure them.  For example, we would
write ‘let Point(x, y, z) = point’.

8.1.1.3 Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields
............................................

You can also define structs that don't have any fields!  These are
called ‘unit-like structs’ because they behave similarly to ‘()’, the
unit type that we mentioned in *note “The Tuple Type”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch03-02-data-typesmd__the-tuple-type. section.
Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on
some type but don't have any data that you want to store in the type
itself.  We'll discuss traits in Chapter 10.  Here's an example of
declaring and instantiating a unit struct named ‘AlwaysEqual’:

struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}

To define ‘AlwaysEqual’, we use the ‘struct’ keyword, the name we want,
and then a semicolon.  No need for curly brackets or parentheses!  Then
we can get an instance of ‘AlwaysEqual’ in the ‘subject’ variable in a
similar way: using the name we defined, without any curly brackets or
parentheses.  Imagine that later we'll implement behavior for this type
such that every instance of ‘AlwaysEqual’ is always equal to every
instance of any other type, perhaps to have a known result for testing
purposes.  We wouldn't need any data to implement that behavior!  You'll
see in Chapter 10 how to define traits and implement them on any type,
including unit-like structs.

8.1.1.4 Ownership of Struct Data
................................

In the ‘User’ struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned
‘String’ type rather than the ‘&str’ string slice type.  This is a
deliberate choice because we want each instance of this struct to own
all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire
struct is valid.

It's also possible for structs to store references to data owned by
something else, but to do so requires the use of ‘lifetimes’, a Rust
feature that we'll discuss in Chapter 10.  Lifetimes ensure that the
data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.
Let's say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying
lifetimes, like the following; this won't work:

struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {

references in structs, but for now, we'll fix errors like these using
owned types like ‘String’ instead of references like ‘&str’.

8.1.2 An Example Program Using Structs
--------------------------------------

To understand when we might want to use structs, let's write a program
that calculates the area of a rectangle.  We'll start by using single
variables, and then refactor the program until we're using structs
instead.

Let's make a new binary project with Cargo called ‘rectangles’ that will
take the width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and
calculate the area of the rectangle.  Listing 5-8 shows a short program
with one way of doing exactly that in our project's ‘src/main.rs’.

fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
    width * height
}

Now, run this program using ‘cargo run’:

$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.

This code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling
the ‘area’ function with each dimension, but we can do more to make this
code clear and readable.

The issue with this code is evident in the signature of ‘area’:

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {

The ‘area’ function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle,
but the function we wrote has two parameters, and it's not clear
anywhere in our program that the parameters are related.  It would be
more readable and more manageable to group width and height together.
We've already discussed one way we might do that in *note “The Tuple
Type”: #book__pandoc__texi__src__ch03-02-data-typesmd__the-tuple-type.
section of Chapter 3: by using tuples.

8.1.2.1 Refactoring with Tuples
...............................

Listing 5-9 shows another version of our program that uses tuples.

fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(rect1)
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}

In one way, this program is better.  Tuples let us add a bit of
structure, and we're now passing just one argument.  But in another way,
this version is less clear: tuples don't name their elements, so we have
to index into the parts of the tuple, making our calculation less
obvious.

Mixing up the width and height wouldn't matter for the area calculation,
but if we want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter!  We
would have to keep in mind that ‘width’ is the tuple index ‘0’ and
‘height’ is the tuple index ‘1’.  This would be even harder for someone
else to figure out and keep in mind if they were to use our code.
Because we haven't conveyed the meaning of our data in our code, it's
now easier to introduce errors.

8.1.2.2 Refactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning
.....................................................

We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data.  We can transform
the tuple we're using into a struct with a name for the whole as well as
names for the parts, as shown in Listing 5-10.

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(&rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}

Here we've defined a struct and named it ‘Rectangle’.  Inside the curly
brackets, we defined the fields as ‘width’ and ‘height’, both of which
have type ‘u32’.  Then, in ‘main’, we created a particular instance of
‘Rectangle’ that has a width of ‘30’ and a height of ‘50’.

Our ‘area’ function is now defined with one parameter, which we've named
‘rectangle’, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct ‘Rectangle’
instance.  As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct
rather than take ownership of it.  This way, ‘main’ retains its
ownership and can continue using ‘rect1’, which is the reason we use the
‘&’ in the function signature and where we call the function.

The ‘area’ function accesses the ‘width’ and ‘height’ fields of the
‘Rectangle’ instance (note that accessing fields of a borrowed struct
instance does not move the field values, which is why you often see
borrows of structs).  Our function signature for ‘area’ now says exactly
what we mean: calculate the area of ‘Rectangle’, using its ‘width’ and
‘height’ fields.  This conveys that the width and height are related to
each other, and it gives descriptive names to the values rather than
using the tuple index values of ‘0’ and ‘1’.  This is a win for clarity.

8.1.2.3 Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits
.......................................................

It'd be useful to be able to print an instance of ‘Rectangle’ while
we're debugging our program and see the values for all its fields.
Listing 5-11 tries using the ‘println!’ macro
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/macro.println.html) as we have
used in previous chapters.  This won't work, however.

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("rect1 is {}", rect1);
}

When we compile this code, we get an error with this core message:

error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`

The ‘println!’ macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default,
the curly brackets tell ‘println!’ to use formatting known as ‘Display’:
output intended for direct end user consumption.  The primitive types
we've seen so far implement ‘Display’ by default because there's only
one way you'd want to show a ‘1’ or any other primitive type to a user.
But with structs, the way ‘println!’ should format the output is less
clear because there are more display possibilities: Do you want commas
or not?  Do you want to print the curly brackets?  Should all the fields
be shown?  Due to this ambiguity, Rust doesn't try to guess what we
want, and structs don't have a provided implementation of ‘Display’ to
use with ‘println!’ and the ‘{}’ placeholder.

If we continue reading the errors, we'll find this helpful note:

   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Rectangle`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead

Let's try it!  The ‘println!’ macro call will now look like
‘println!("rect1 is {rect1:?}");’.  Putting the specifier ‘:?’ inside
the curly brackets tells ‘println!’ we want to use an output format
called ‘Debug’.  The ‘Debug’ trait enables us to print our struct in a
way that is useful for developers so we can see its value while we're
debugging our code.

Compile the code with this change.  Drat!  We still get an error:

error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `Debug`

But again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:

   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Rectangle`
   = note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` to `Rectangle` or manually `impl Debug for Rectangle`

Rust ‘does’ include functionality to print out debugging information,
but we have to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available
for our struct.  To do that, we add the outer attribute
‘#[derive(Debug)]’ just before the struct definition, as shown in
Listing 5-12.

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("rect1 is {rect1:?}");
}

Now when we run the program, we won't get any errors, and we'll see the
following output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }

Nice!  It's not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the
fields for this instance, which would definitely help during debugging.
When we have larger structs, it's useful to have output that's a bit
easier to read; in those cases, we can use ‘{:#?}’ instead of ‘{:?}’ in
the ‘println!’ string.  In this example, using the ‘{:#?}’ style will
output the following:

$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}

Another way to print out a value using the ‘Debug’ format is to use the
‘dbg!’ macro (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/macro.dbg.html),
which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed to ‘println!’, which
takes a reference), prints the file and line number of where that ‘dbg!’
macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value of that
expression, and returns ownership of the value.

Note: Calling the ‘dbg!’ macro prints to the standard error console
stream (‘stderr’), as opposed to ‘println!’, which prints to the
standard output console stream (‘stdout’).  We'll talk more about
‘stderr’ and ‘stdout’ in the *note “Writing Error Messages to Standard
Error Instead of Standard Output” section in Chapter 12: Writing Error
Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output.

Here's an example where we're interested in the value that gets assigned
to the ‘width’ field, as well as the value of the whole struct in
‘rect1’:

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };

    dbg!(&rect1);
}

We can put ‘dbg!’ around the expression ‘30 * scale’ and, because ‘dbg!’
returns ownership of the expression's value, the ‘width’ field will get
the same value as if we didn't have the ‘dbg!’ call there.  We don't
want ‘dbg!’ to take ownership of ‘rect1’, so we use a reference to
‘rect1’ in the next call.  Here's what the output of this example looks
like:

$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
[src/main.rs:10:16] 30 * scale = 60
[src/main.rs:14:5] &rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}

We can see the first bit of output came from ‘src/main.rs’ line 10 where
we're debugging the expression ‘30 * scale’, and its resultant value is
‘60’ (the ‘Debug’ formatting implemented for integers is to print only
their value).  The ‘dbg!’ call on line 14 of ‘src/main.rs’ outputs the
value of ‘&rect1’, which is the ‘Rectangle’ struct.  This output uses
the pretty ‘Debug’ formatting of the ‘Rectangle’ type.  The ‘dbg!’ macro
can be really helpful when you're trying to figure out what your code is
doing!

In addition to the ‘Debug’ trait, Rust has provided a number of traits
for us to use with the ‘derive’ attribute that can add useful behavior
to our custom types.  Those traits and their behaviors are listed in
*note Appendix C: Appendix C Derivable Traits.  We'll cover how to
implement these traits with custom behavior as well as how to create
your own traits in Chapter 10.  There are also many attributes other
than ‘derive’; for more information, see the “Attributes” section of the
Rust Reference
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../reference/attributes.html).

Our ‘area’ function is very specific: it only computes the area of
rectangles.  It would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to
our ‘Rectangle’ struct because it won't work with any other type.  Let's
look at how we can continue to refactor this code by turning the ‘area’
function into an ‘area’ ‘method’ defined on our ‘Rectangle’ type.

8.1.3 Method Syntax
-------------------

‘Methods’ are similar to functions: we declare them with the ‘fn’
keyword and a name, they can have parameters and a return value, and
they contain some code that's run when the method is called from
somewhere else.  Unlike functions, methods are defined within the
context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in
*note Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching. and *note Chapter 17: Using
Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types, respectively),
and their first parameter is always ‘self’, which represents the
instance of the struct the method is being called on.

* Where's the -> Operator?::
* Methods with More Parameters::
* Associated Functions::
* Multiple impl Blocks::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Defining Methods,  Next: Where's the -> Operator?,  Prev: Method Syntax,  Up: Method Syntax

8.1.3.1 Defining Methods
........................

Let's change the ‘area’ function that has a ‘Rectangle’ instance as a
parameter and instead make an ‘area’ method defined on the ‘Rectangle’
struct, as shown in Listing 5-13.

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
}

To define the function within the context of ‘Rectangle’, we start an
‘impl’ (implementation) block for ‘Rectangle’.  Everything within this
‘impl’ block will be associated with the ‘Rectangle’ type.  Then we move
the ‘area’ function within the ‘impl’ curly brackets and change the
first (and in this case, only) parameter to be ‘self’ in the signature
and everywhere within the body.  In ‘main’, where we called the ‘area’
function and passed ‘rect1’ as an argument, we can instead use ‘method
syntax’ to call the ‘area’ method on our ‘Rectangle’ instance.  The
method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by the
method name, parentheses, and any arguments.

In the signature for ‘area’, we use ‘&self’ instead of ‘rectangle:
&Rectangle’.  The ‘&self’ is actually short for ‘self: &Self’.  Within
an ‘impl’ block, the type ‘Self’ is an alias for the type that the
‘impl’ block is for.  Methods must have a parameter named ‘self’ of type
‘Self’ for their first parameter, so Rust lets you abbreviate this with
only the name ‘self’ in the first parameter spot.  Note that we still
need to use the ‘&’ in front of the ‘self’ shorthand to indicate that
this method borrows the ‘Self’ instance, just as we did in ‘rectangle:
&Rectangle’.  Methods can take ownership of ‘self’, borrow ‘self’
immutably, as we've done here, or borrow ‘self’ mutably, just as they
can any other parameter.

We chose ‘&self’ here for the same reason we used ‘&Rectangle’ in the
function version: we don't want to take ownership, and we just want to
read the data in the struct, not write to it.  If we wanted to change
the instance that we've called the method on as part of what the method
does, we'd use ‘&mut self’ as the first parameter.  Having a method that
takes ownership of the instance by using just ‘self’ as the first
parameter is rare; this technique is usually used when the method
transforms ‘self’ into something else and you want to prevent the caller
from using the original instance after the transformation.

The main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to
providing method syntax and not having to repeat the type of ‘self’ in
every method's signature, is for organization.  We've put all the things
we can do with an instance of a type in one ‘impl’ block rather than
making future users of our code search for capabilities of ‘Rectangle’
in various places in the library we provide.

Note that we can choose to give a method the same name as one of the
struct's fields.  For example, we can define a method on ‘Rectangle’
that is also named ‘width’:

impl Rectangle {
    fn width(&self) -> bool {
        self.width > 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    if rect1.width() {
        println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
    }
}

Here, we're choosing to make the ‘width’ method return ‘true’ if the
value in the instance's ‘width’ field is greater than ‘0’ and ‘false’ if
the value is ‘0’: we can use a field within a method of the same name
for any purpose.  In ‘main’, when we follow ‘rect1.width’ with
parentheses, Rust knows we mean the method ‘width’.  When we don't use
parentheses, Rust knows we mean the field ‘width’.

Often, but not always, when we give a method the same name as a field we
want it to only return the value in the field and do nothing else.
Methods like this are called ‘getters’, and Rust does not implement them
automatically for struct fields as some other languages do.  Getters are
useful because you can make the field private but the method public, and
thus enable read-only access to that field as part of the type's public
API. We will discuss what public and private are and how to designate a
field or method as public or private in *note Chapter 7: Exposing Paths
with the pub Keyword.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Where's the -> Operator?,  Next: Methods with More Parameters,  Prev: Defining Methods,  Up: Method Syntax

8.1.3.2 Where's the ‘->’ Operator?
..................................

In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods: you
use ‘.’ if you're calling a method on the object directly and ‘->’ if
you're calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to
dereference the pointer first.  In other words, if ‘object’ is a
pointer, ‘object->something()’ is similar to ‘(*object).something()’.

Rust doesn't have an equivalent to the ‘->’ operator; instead, Rust has
a feature called ‘automatic referencing and dereferencing’.  Calling
methods is one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.

Here's how it works: when you call a method with ‘object.something()’,
Rust automatically adds in ‘&’, ‘&mut’, or ‘*’ so ‘object’ matches the
signature of the method.  In other words, the following are the same:

p1.distance(&p2);
(&p1).distance(&p2);

The first one looks much cleaner.  This automatic referencing behavior
works because methods have a clear receiver--the type of ‘self’.  Given
the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively
whether the method is reading (‘&self’), mutating (‘&mut self’), or
consuming (‘self’).  The fact that Rust makes borrowing implicit for
method receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in
practice.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Methods with More Parameters,  Next: Associated Functions,  Prev: Where's the -> Operator?,  Up: Method Syntax

8.1.3.3 Methods with More Parameters
....................................

Let's practice using methods by implementing a second method on the
‘Rectangle’ struct.  This time we want an instance of ‘Rectangle’ to
take another instance of ‘Rectangle’ and return ‘true’ if the second
‘Rectangle’ can fit completely within ‘self’ (the first ‘Rectangle’);
otherwise, it should return ‘false’.  That is, once we've defined the
‘can_hold’ method, we want to be able to write the program shown in
Listing 5-14.

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };
    let rect2 = Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 40,
    };
    let rect3 = Rectangle {
        width: 60,
        height: 45,
    };

    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
}

The expected output would look like the following because both
dimensions of ‘rect2’ are smaller than the dimensions of ‘rect1’, but
‘rect3’ is wider than ‘rect1’:

Can rect1 hold rect2? true
Can rect1 hold rect3? false

We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the ‘impl
Rectangle’ block.  The method name will be ‘can_hold’, and it will take
an immutable borrow of another ‘Rectangle’ as a parameter.  We can tell
what the type of the parameter will be by looking at the code that calls
the method: ‘rect1.can_hold(&rect2)’ passes in ‘&rect2’, which is an
immutable borrow to ‘rect2’, an instance of ‘Rectangle’.  This makes
sense because we only need to read ‘rect2’ (rather than write, which
would mean we'd need a mutable borrow), and we want ‘main’ to retain
ownership of ‘rect2’ so we can use it again after calling the ‘can_hold’
method.  The return value of ‘can_hold’ will be a Boolean, and the
implementation will check whether the width and height of ‘self’ are
greater than the width and height of the other ‘Rectangle’,
respectively.  Let's add the new ‘can_hold’ method to the ‘impl’ block
from Listing 5-13, shown in Listing 5-15.

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

When we run this code with the ‘main’ function in Listing 5-14, we'll
get our desired output.  Methods can take multiple parameters that we
add to the signature after the ‘self’ parameter, and those parameters
work just like parameters in functions.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Associated Functions,  Next: Multiple impl Blocks,  Prev: Methods with More Parameters,  Up: Method Syntax

8.1.3.4 Associated Functions
............................

All functions defined within an ‘impl’ block are called ‘associated
functions’ because they're associated with the type named after the
‘impl’.  We can define associated functions that don't have ‘self’ as
their first parameter (and thus are not methods) because they don't need
an instance of the type to work with.  We've already used one function
like this: the ‘String::from’ function that's defined on the ‘String’
type.

Associated functions that aren't methods are often used for constructors
that will return a new instance of the struct.  These are often called
‘new’, but ‘new’ isn't a special name and isn't built into the language.
For example, we could choose to provide an associated function named
‘square’ that would have one dimension parameter and use that as both
width and height, thus making it easier to create a square ‘Rectangle’
rather than having to specify the same value twice:

Filename: src/main.rs

impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}

The ‘Self’ keywords in the return type and in the body of the function
are aliases for the type that appears after the ‘impl’ keyword, which in
this case is ‘Rectangle’.

To call this associated function, we use the ‘::’ syntax with the struct
name; ‘let sq = Rectangle::square(3);’ is an example.  This function is
namespaced by the struct: the ‘::’ syntax is used for both associated
functions and namespaces created by modules.  We'll discuss modules in
*note Chapter 7: Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Multiple impl Blocks,  Next: Summary 5,  Prev: Associated Functions,  Up: Method Syntax

8.1.3.5 Multiple ‘impl’ Blocks
..............................

Each struct is allowed to have multiple ‘impl’ blocks.  For example,
Listing 5-15 is equivalent to the code shown in Listing 5-16, which has
each method in its own ‘impl’ block.

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

There's no reason to separate these methods into multiple ‘impl’ blocks
here, but this is valid syntax.  We'll see a case in which multiple
‘impl’ blocks are useful in Chapter 10, where we discuss generic types
and traits.

By using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to
each other and name each piece to make your code clear.  In ‘impl’
blocks, you can define functions that are associated with your type, and
methods are a kind of associated function that let you specify the
behavior that instances of your structs have.

But structs aren't the only way you can create custom types: let's turn
to Rust's enum feature to add another tool to your toolbox.

9 Enums and Pattern Matching
****************************

In this chapter, we'll look at ‘enumerations’, also referred to as
‘enums’.  Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible
‘variants’.  First we'll define and use an enum to show how an enum can
encode meaning along with data.  Next, we'll explore a particularly
useful enum, called ‘Option’, which expresses that a value can be either
something or nothing.  Then we'll look at how pattern matching in the
‘match’ expression makes it easy to run different code for different
values of an enum.  Finally, we'll cover how the ‘if let’ construct is
another convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in your
code.

9.1 Defining an Enum
====================

Where structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and
data, like a ‘Rectangle’ with its ‘width’ and ‘height’, enums give you a
way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values.  For example,
we may want to say that ‘Rectangle’ is one of a set of possible shapes
that also includes ‘Circle’ and ‘Triangle’.  To do this, Rust allows us
to encode these possibilities as an enum.

Let's look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why
enums are useful and more appropriate than structs in this case.  Say we
need to work with IP addresses.  Currently, two major standards are used
for IP addresses: version four and version six.  Because these are the
only possibilities for an IP address that our program will come across,
we can ‘enumerate’ all possible variants, which is where enumeration
gets its name.

Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address,
but not both at the same time.  That property of IP addresses makes the
enum data structure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of
its variants.  Both version four and version six addresses are still
fundamentally IP addresses, so they should be treated as the same type
when the code is handling situations that apply to any kind of IP
address.

We can express this concept in code by defining an ‘IpAddrKind’
enumeration and listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, ‘V4’
and ‘V6’.  These are the variants of the enum:

enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

‘IpAddrKind’ is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our
code.

9.1.1 Enum Values
-----------------

We can create instances of each of the two variants of ‘IpAddrKind’ like
this:

    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;

Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier,
and we use a double colon to separate the two.  This is useful because
now both values ‘IpAddrKind::V4’ and ‘IpAddrKind::V6’ are of the same
type: ‘IpAddrKind’.  We can then, for instance, define a function that
takes any ‘IpAddrKind’:

fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

And we can call this function with either variant:

    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
    route(IpAddrKind::V6);

Using enums has even more advantages.  Thinking more about our IP
address type, at the moment we don't have a way to store the actual IP
address ‘data’; we only know what ‘kind’ it is.  Given that you just
learned about structs in Chapter 5, you might be tempted to tackle this
problem with structs as shown in Listing 6-1.

    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }

    struct IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind,
        address: String,
    }

    let home = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
        address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
    };

    let loopback = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
        address: String::from("::1"),
    };

Here, we've defined a struct ‘IpAddr’ that has two fields: a ‘kind’
field that is of type ‘IpAddrKind’ (the enum we defined previously) and
an ‘address’ field of type ‘String’.  We have two instances of this
struct.  The first is ‘home’, and it has the value ‘IpAddrKind::V4’ as
its ‘kind’ with associated address data of ‘127.0.0.1’.  The second
instance is ‘loopback’.  It has the other variant of ‘IpAddrKind’ as its
‘kind’ value, ‘V6’, and has address ‘::1’ associated with it.  We've
used a struct to bundle the ‘kind’ and ‘address’ values together, so now
the variant is associated with the value.

However, representing the same concept using just an enum is more
concise: rather than an enum inside a struct, we can put data directly
into each enum variant.  This new definition of the ‘IpAddr’ enum says
that both ‘V4’ and ‘V6’ variants will have associated ‘String’ values:

    enum IpAddr {
        V4(String),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));

We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need
for an extra struct.  Here, it's also easier to see another detail of
how enums work: the name of each enum variant that we define also
becomes a function that constructs an instance of the enum.  That is,
‘IpAddr::V4()’ is a function call that takes a ‘String’ argument and
returns an instance of the ‘IpAddr’ type.  We automatically get this
constructor function defined as a result of defining the enum.

There's another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each
variant can have different types and amounts of associated data.
Version four IP addresses will always have four numeric components that
will have values between 0 and 255.  If we wanted to store ‘V4’
addresses as four ‘u8’ values but still express ‘V6’ addresses as one
‘String’ value, we wouldn't be able to with a struct.  Enums handle this
case with ease:

    enum IpAddr {
        V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));

We've shown several different ways to define data structures to store
version four and version six IP addresses.  However, as it turns out,
wanting to store IP addresses and encode which kind they are is so
common that the standard library has a definition we can use!
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/net/enum.IpAddr.html) Let's look
at how the standard library defines ‘IpAddr’: it has the exact enum and
variants that we've defined and used, but it embeds the address data
inside the variants in the form of two different structs, which are
defined differently for each variant:

struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}

This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum
variant: strings, numeric types, or structs, for example.  You can even
include another enum!  Also, standard library types are often not much
more complicated than what you might come up with.

Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for
‘IpAddr’, we can still create and use our own definition without
conflict because we haven't brought the standard library's definition
into our scope.  We'll talk more about bringing types into scope in
Chapter 7.

Let's look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a
wide variety of types embedded in its variants.

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

This enum has four variants with different types:

   • ‘Quit’ has no data associated with it at all.
   • ‘Move’ has named fields, like a struct does.
   • ‘Write’ includes a single ‘String’.
   • ‘ChangeColor’ includes three ‘i32’ values.

Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is
similar to defining different kinds of struct definitions, except the
enum doesn't use the ‘struct’ keyword and all the variants are grouped
together under the ‘Message’ type.  The following structs could hold the
same data that the preceding enum variants hold:

struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct

But if we used the different structs, each of which has its own type, we
couldn't as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of
messages as we could with the ‘Message’ enum defined in Listing 6-2,
which is a single type.

There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we're
able to define methods on structs using ‘impl’, we're also able to
define methods on enums.  Here's a method named ‘call’ that we could
define on our ‘Message’ enum:

    impl Message {
        fn call(&self) {
            // method body would be defined here
        }
    }

    let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
    m.call();

The body of the method would use ‘self’ to get the value that we called
the method on.  In this example, we've created a variable ‘m’ that has
the value ‘Message::Write(String::from("hello"))’, and that is what
‘self’ will be in the body of the ‘call’ method when ‘m.call()’ runs.

Let's look at another enum in the standard library that is very common
and useful: ‘Option’.

9.1.1.1 The ‘Option’ Enum and Its Advantages Over Null
......................................................

Values This section explores a case study of ‘Option’, which is another
enum defined by the standard library.  The ‘Option’ type encodes the
very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be
nothing.

For example, if you request the first item in a non-empty list, you
would get a value.  If you request the first item in an empty list, you
would get nothing.  Expressing this concept in terms of the type system
means the compiler can check whether you've handled all the cases you
should be handling; this functionality can prevent bugs that are
extremely common in other programming languages.

Programming language design is often thought of in terms of which
features you include, but the features you exclude are important too.
Rust doesn't have the null feature that many other languages have.
‘Null’ is a value that means there is no value there.  In languages with
null, variables can always be in one of two states: null or not-null.

In his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,”
Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say:

I call it my billion-dollar mistake.  At that time, I was designing the
first comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented
language.  My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be
absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler.
But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply
because it was so easy to implement.  This has led to innumerable
errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused
a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.

The problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a
not-null value, you'll get an error of some kind.  Because this null or
not-null property is pervasive, it's extremely easy to make this kind of
error.

However, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful
one: a null is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some
reason.

The problem isn't really with the concept but with the particular
implementation.  As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an
enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent.
This enum is ‘Option<T>’, and it is defined by the standard library
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/option/enum.Option.html) as
follows:

enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}

The ‘Option<T>’ enum is so useful that it's even included in the
prelude; you don't need to bring it into scope explicitly.  Its variants
are also included in the prelude: you can use ‘Some’ and ‘None’ directly
without the ‘Option::’ prefix.  The ‘Option<T>’ enum is still just a
regular enum, and ‘Some(T)’ and ‘None’ are still variants of type
‘Option<T>’.

The ‘<T>’ syntax is a feature of Rust we haven't talked about yet.  It's
a generic type parameter, and we'll cover generics in more detail in
Chapter 10.  For now, all you need to know is that ‘<T>’ means that the
‘Some’ variant of the ‘Option’ enum can hold one piece of data of any
type, and that each concrete type that gets used in place of ‘T’ makes
the overall ‘Option<T>’ type a different type.  Here are some examples
of using ‘Option’ values to hold number types and string types:

    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_char = Some('e');

    let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;

The type of ‘some_number’ is ‘Option<i32>’.  The type of ‘some_char’ is
‘Option<char>’, which is a different type.  Rust can infer these types
because we've specified a value inside the ‘Some’ variant.  For
‘absent_number’, Rust requires us to annotate the overall ‘Option’ type:
the compiler can't infer the type that the corresponding ‘Some’ variant
will hold by looking only at a ‘None’ value.  Here, we tell Rust that we
mean for ‘absent_number’ to be of type ‘Option<i32>’.

When we have a ‘Some’ value, we know that a value is present and the
value is held within the ‘Some’.  When we have a ‘None’ value, in some
sense it means the same thing as null: we don't have a valid value.  So
why is having ‘Option<T>’ any better than having null?

In short, because ‘Option<T>’ and ‘T’ (where ‘T’ can be any type) are
different types, the compiler won't let us use an ‘Option<T>’ value as
if it were definitely a valid value.  For example, this code won't
compile, because it's trying to add an ‘i8’ to an ‘Option<i8>’:

    let x: i8 = 5;
    let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

    let sum = x + y;

If we run this code, we get an error message like this one:

$ cargo run
   Compiling enums v0.1.0 (file:///projects/enums)
error[E0277]: cannot add `Option<i8>` to `i8`
 --> src/main.rs:5:17
  |
5 |     let sum = x + y;
  |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + Option<i8>`
  |
  = help: the trait `Add<Option<i8>>` is not implemented for `i8`
  = help: the following other types implement trait `Add<Rhs>`:
            `&'a i8` implements `Add<i8>`
            `&i8` implements `Add<&i8>`
            `i8` implements `Add<&i8>`
            `i8` implements `Add`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.
error: could not compile `enums` (bin "enums") due to 1 previous error

Intense!  In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn't
understand how to add an ‘i8’ and an ‘Option<i8>’, because they're
different types.  When we have a value of a type like ‘i8’ in Rust, the
compiler will ensure that we always have a valid value.  We can proceed
confidently without having to check for null before using that value.
Only when we have an ‘Option<i8>’ (or whatever type of value we're
working with) do we have to worry about possibly not having a value, and
the compiler will make sure we handle that case before using the value.

In other words, you have to convert an ‘Option<T>’ to a ‘T’ before you
can perform ‘T’ operations with it.  Generally, this helps catch one of
the most common issues with null: assuming that something isn't null
when it actually is.

Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you
to be more confident in your code.  In order to have a value that can
possibly be null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that
value ‘Option<T>’.  Then, when you use that value, you are required to
explicitly handle the case when the value is null.  Everywhere that a
value has a type that isn't an ‘Option<T>’, you ‘can’ safely assume that
the value isn't null.  This was a deliberate design decision for Rust to
limit null's pervasiveness and increase the safety of Rust code.

So how do you get the ‘T’ value out of a ‘Some’ variant when you have a
value of type ‘Option<T>’ so that you can use that value?  The
‘Option<T>’ enum has a large number of methods that are useful in a
variety of situations; you can check them out in its documentation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/option/enum.Option.html).
Becoming familiar with the methods on ‘Option<T>’ will be extremely
useful in your journey with Rust.

In general, in order to use an ‘Option<T>’ value, you want to have code
that will handle each variant.  You want some code that will run only
when you have a ‘Some(T)’ value, and this code is allowed to use the
inner ‘T’.  You want some other code to run only if you have a ‘None’
value, and that code doesn't have a ‘T’ value available.  The ‘match’
expression is a control flow construct that does just this when used
with enums: it will run different code depending on which variant of the
enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching value.

9.1.2 The ‘match’ Control Flow Construct
----------------------------------------

Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called ‘match’
that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then
execute code based on which pattern matches.  Patterns can be made up of
literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things; *note
Chapter 18: Patterns and Matching. covers all the different kinds of
patterns and what they do.  The power of ‘match’ comes from the
expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms
that all possible cases are handled.

Think of a ‘match’ expression as being like a coin-sorting machine:
coins slide down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each
coin falls through the first hole it encounters that it fits into.  In
the same way, values go through each pattern in a ‘match’, and at the
first pattern the value “fits,” the value falls into the associated code
block to be used during execution.

Speaking of coins, let's use them as an example using ‘match’!  We can
write a function that takes an unknown US coin and, in a similar way as
the counting machine, determines which coin it is and returns its value
in cents, as shown in Listing 6-3.

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}

Let's break down the ‘match’ in the ‘value_in_cents’ function.  First we
list the ‘match’ keyword followed by an expression, which in this case
is the value ‘coin’.  This seems very similar to a conditional
expression used with ‘if’, but there's a big difference: with ‘if’, the
condition needs to evaluate to a Boolean value, but here it can be any
type.  The type of ‘coin’ in this example is the ‘Coin’ enum that we
defined on the first line.

Next are the ‘match’ arms.  An arm has two parts: a pattern and some
code.  The first arm here has a pattern that is the value ‘Coin::Penny’
and then the ‘=>’ operator that separates the pattern and the code to
run.  The code in this case is just the value ‘1’.  Each arm is
separated from the next with a comma.

When the ‘match’ expression executes, it compares the resultant value
against the pattern of each arm, in order.  If a pattern matches the
value, the code associated with that pattern is executed.  If that
pattern doesn't match the value, execution continues to the next arm,
much as in a coin-sorting machine.  We can have as many arms as we need:
in Listing 6-3, our ‘match’ has four arms.

The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant
value of the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets
returned for the entire ‘match’ expression.

We don't typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as
it is in Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value.  If you want
to run multiple lines of code in a match arm, you must use curly
brackets, and the comma following the arm is then optional.  For
example, the following code prints “Lucky penny!” every time the method
is called with a ‘Coin::Penny’, but still returns the last value of the
block, ‘1’:

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => {
            println!("Lucky penny!");
            1
        }
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}

9.1.2.1 Patterns That Bind to Values
....................................

Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts
of the values that match the pattern.  This is how we can extract values
out of enum variants.

As an example, let's change one of our enum variants to hold data inside
it.  From 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with
different designs for each of the 50 states on one side.  No other coins
got state designs, so only quarters have this extra value.  We can add
this information to our ‘enum’ by changing the ‘Quarter’ variant to
include a ‘UsState’ value stored inside it, which we've done in Listing
6-4.

enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

Let's imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters.
While we sort our loose change by coin type, we'll also call out the
name of the state associated with each quarter so that if it's one our
friend doesn't have, they can add it to their collection.

In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called ‘state’
to the pattern that matches values of the variant ‘Coin::Quarter’.  When
a ‘Coin::Quarter’ matches, the ‘state’ variable will bind to the value
of that quarter's state.  Then we can use ‘state’ in the code for that
arm, like so:

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
            25
        }
    }
}

If we were to call ‘value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))’,
‘coin’ would be ‘Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)’.  When we compare that
value with each of the match arms, none of them match until we reach
‘Coin::Quarter(state)’.  At that point, the binding for ‘state’ will be
the value ‘UsState::Alaska’.  We can then use that binding in the
‘println!’ expression, thus getting the inner state value out of the
‘Coin’ enum variant for ‘Quarter’.

9.1.2.2 Matching with ‘Option<T>’
.................................

In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner ‘T’ value out of the
‘Some’ case when using ‘Option<T>’; we can also handle ‘Option<T>’ using
‘match’, as we did with the ‘Coin’ enum!  Instead of comparing coins,
we'll compare the variants of ‘Option<T>’, but the way the ‘match’
expression works remains the same.

Let's say we want to write a function that takes an ‘Option<i32>’ and,
if there's a value inside, adds 1 to that value.  If there isn't a value
inside, the function should return the ‘None’ value and not attempt to
perform any operations.

This function is very easy to write, thanks to ‘match’, and will look
like Listing 6-5.

    fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            None => None,
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }

    let five = Some(5);
    let six = plus_one(five);
    let none = plus_one(None);

Let's examine the first execution of ‘plus_one’ in more detail.  When we
call ‘plus_one(five)’, the variable ‘x’ in the body of ‘plus_one’ will
have the value ‘Some(5)’.  We then compare that against each match arm:

            None => None,

The ‘Some(5)’ value doesn't match the pattern ‘None’, so we continue to
the next arm:

            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),

Does ‘Some(5)’ match ‘Some(i)’?  It does!  We have the same variant.
The ‘i’ binds to the value contained in ‘Some’, so ‘i’ takes the value
‘5’.  The code in the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the
value of ‘i’ and create a new ‘Some’ value with our total ‘6’ inside.

Now let's consider the second call of ‘plus_one’ in Listing 6-5, where
‘x’ is ‘None’.  We enter the ‘match’ and compare to the first arm:

            None => None,

It matches!  There's no value to add to, so the program stops and
returns the ‘None’ value on the right side of ‘=>’.  Because the first
arm matched, no other arms are compared.

Combining ‘match’ and enums is useful in many situations.  You'll see
this pattern a lot in Rust code: ‘match’ against an enum, bind a
variable to the data inside, and then execute code based on it.  It's a
bit tricky at first, but once you get used to it, you'll wish you had it
in all languages.  It's consistently a user favorite.

9.1.2.3 Matches Are Exhaustive
..............................

There's one other aspect of ‘match’ we need to discuss: the arms'
patterns must cover all possibilities.  Consider this version of our
‘plus_one’ function, which has a bug and won't compile:

    fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }

We didn't handle the ‘None’ case, so this code will cause a bug.
Luckily, it's a bug Rust knows how to catch.  If we try to compile this
code, we'll get this error:

$ cargo run

Rust knows that we didn't cover every possible case, and even knows
which pattern we forgot!  Matches in Rust are ‘exhaustive’: we must
exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid.
Especially in the case of ‘Option<T>’, when Rust prevents us from
forgetting to explicitly handle the ‘None’ case, it protects us from
assuming that we have a value when we might have null, thus making the
billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.

9.1.2.4 Catch-all Patterns and the ‘_’ Placeholder
..................................................

Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular
values, but for all other values take one default action.  Imagine we're
implementing a game where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player
doesn't move, but instead gets a new fancy hat.  If you roll a 7, your
player loses a fancy hat.  For all other values, your player moves that
number of spaces on the game board.  Here's a ‘match’ that implements
that logic, with the result of the dice roll hardcoded rather than a
random value, and all other logic represented by functions without
bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for this
example:

    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        other => move_player(other),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}

For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values ‘3’ and ‘7’.
For the last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is
the variable we've chosen to name ‘other’.  The code that runs for the
‘other’ arm uses the variable by passing it to the ‘move_player’
function.

This code compiles, even though we haven't listed all the possible
values a ‘u8’ can have, because the last pattern will match all values
not specifically listed.  This catch-all pattern meets the requirement
that ‘match’ must be exhaustive.  Note that we have to put the catch-all
arm last because the patterns are evaluated in order.  If we put the
catch-all arm earlier, the other arms would never run, so Rust will warn
us if we add arms after a catch-all!

Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don't
want to ‘use’ the value in the catch-all pattern: ‘_’ is a special
pattern that matches any value and does not bind to that value.  This
tells Rust we aren't going to use the value, so Rust won't warn us about
an unused variable.

Let's change the rules of the game: now, if you roll anything other than
a 3 or a 7, you must roll again.  We no longer need to use the catch-all
value, so we can change our code to use ‘_’ instead of the variable
named ‘other’:

    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ => reroll(),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn reroll() {}

This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we're
explicitly ignoring all other values in the last arm; we haven't
forgotten anything.

Finally, we'll change the rules of the game one more time so that
nothing else happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or
a 7.  We can express that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type
we mentioned in *note “The Tuple Type”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch03-02-data-typesmd__the-tuple-type. section)
as the code that goes with the ‘_’ arm:

    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ => (),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}

Here, we're telling Rust explicitly that we aren't going to use any
other value that doesn't match a pattern in an earlier arm, and we don't
want to run any code in this case.

There's more about patterns and matching that we'll cover in *note
Chapter 19: Patterns and Matching.  For now, we're going to move on to
the ‘if let’ syntax, which can be useful in situations where the ‘match’
expression is a bit wordy.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Concise Control Flow with if let,  Next: Summary 6,  Prev: The match Control Flow Construct,  Up: Enums and Pattern Matching

9.1.3 Concise Control Flow with ‘if let’
----------------------------------------

The ‘if let’ syntax lets you combine ‘if’ and ‘let’ into a less verbose
way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.
Consider the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an ‘Option<u8>’
value in the ‘config_max’ variable but only wants to execute code if the
value is the ‘Some’ variant.

    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}"),
        _ => (),
    }

If the value is ‘Some’, we print out the value in the ‘Some’ variant by
binding the value to the variable ‘max’ in the pattern.  We don't want
to do anything with the ‘None’ value.  To satisfy the ‘match’
expression, we have to add ‘_ => ()’ after processing just one variant,
which is annoying boilerplate code to add.

Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using ‘if let’.  The
following code behaves the same as the ‘match’ in Listing 6-6:

    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
    }

The syntax ‘if let’ takes a pattern and an expression separated by an
equal sign.  It works the same way as a ‘match’, where the expression is
given to the ‘match’ and the pattern is its first arm.  In this case,
the pattern is ‘Some(max)’, and the ‘max’ binds to the value inside the
‘Some’.  We can then use ‘max’ in the body of the ‘if let’ block in the
same way we used ‘max’ in the corresponding ‘match’ arm.  The code in
the ‘if let’ block only runs if the value matches the pattern.

Using ‘if let’ means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate
code.  However, you lose the exhaustive checking that ‘match’ enforces.
Choosing between ‘match’ and ‘if let’ depends on what you're doing in
your particular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an
appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.

In other words, you can think of ‘if let’ as syntax sugar for a ‘match’
that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all
other values.

We can include an ‘else’ with an ‘if let’.  The block of code that goes
with the ‘else’ is the same as the block of code that would go with the
‘_’ case in the ‘match’ expression that is equivalent to the ‘if let’
and ‘else’.  Recall the ‘Coin’ enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the
‘Quarter’ variant also held a ‘UsState’ value.  If we wanted to count
all non-quarter coins we see while also announcing the state of the
quarters, we could do that with a ‘match’ expression, like this:

    let mut count = 0;
    match coin {
        Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {state:?}!"),
        _ => count += 1,
    }

Or we could use an ‘if let’ and ‘else’ expression, like this:

    let mut count = 0;
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
    } else {
        count += 1;
    }

If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too
verbose to express using a ‘match’, remember that ‘if let’ is in your
Rust toolbox as well.

9.1.4 Summary
-------------

We've now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be
one of a set of enumerated values.  We've shown how the standard
library's ‘Option<T>’ type helps you use the type system to prevent
errors.  When enum values have data inside them, you can use ‘match’ or
‘if let’ to extract and use those values, depending on how many cases
you need to handle.

Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs
and enums.  Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type
safety: the compiler will make certain your functions only get values of
the type each function expects.

In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is
straightforward to use and only exposes exactly what your users will
need, let's now turn to Rust's modules.

10 Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules
***************************************************************

As you write large programs, organizing your code will become
increasingly important.  By grouping related functionality and
separating code with distinct features, you'll clarify where to find
code that implements a particular feature and where to go to change how
a feature works.

The programs we've written so far have been in one module in one file.
As a project grows, you should organize code by splitting it into
multiple modules and then multiple files.  A package can contain
multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate.  As a package
grows, you can extract parts into separate crates that become external
dependencies.  This chapter covers all these techniques.  For very large
projects comprising a set of interrelated packages that evolve together,
Cargo provides ‘workspaces’, which we'll cover in the *note “Cargo
Workspaces”: Cargo Workspaces. section in Chapter 14.

We'll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you
reuse code at a higher level: once you've implemented an operation,
other code can call your code via its public interface without having to
know how the implementation works.  The way you write code defines which
parts are public for other code to use and which parts are private
implementation details that you reserve the right to change.  This is
another way to limit the amount of detail you have to keep in your head.

A related concept is scope: the nested context in which code is written
has a set of names that are defined as “in scope.” When reading,
writing, and compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know
whether a particular name at a particular spot refers to a variable,
function, struct, enum, module, constant, or other item and what that
item means.  You can create scopes and change which names are in or out
of scope.  You can't have two items with the same name in the same
scope; tools are available to resolve name conflicts.

Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code's
organization, including which details are exposed, which details are
private, and what names are in each scope in your programs.  These
features, sometimes collectively referred to as the ‘module system’,
include:

   • *Packages:* A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share
     crates
   • *Crates:* A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
   • *Modules* and *use:* Let you control the organization, scope, and
     privacy of paths
   • *Paths:* A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or
     module

In this chapter, we'll cover all these features, discuss how they
interact, and explain how to use them to manage scope.  By the end, you
should have a solid understanding of the module system and be able to
work with scopes like a pro!

10.1 Packages and Crates
========================

The first parts of the module system we'll cover are packages and
crates.

A ‘crate’ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler
considers at a time.  Even if you run ‘rustc’ rather than ‘cargo’ and
pass a single source code file (as we did all the way back in the
“Writing and Running a Rust Program” section of Chapter 1), the compiler
considers that file to be a crate.  Crates can contain modules, and the
modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate,
as we'll see in the coming sections.

A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.
‘Binary crates’ are programs you can compile to an executable that you
can run, such as a command-line program or a server.  Each must have a
function called ‘main’ that defines what happens when the executable
runs.  All the crates we've created so far have been binary crates.

‘Library crates’ don't have a ‘main’ function, and they don't compile to
an executable.  Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared
with multiple projects.  For example, the ‘rand’ crate we used in *note
Chapter 2: Generating a Random Number. provides functionality that
generates random numbers.  Most of the time when Rustaceans say “crate”,
they mean library crate, and they use “crate” interchangeably with the
general programming concept of a “library”.

The ‘crate root’ is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and
makes up the root module of your crate (we'll explain modules in depth
in the *note “Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy”: Defining
Modules to Control Scope and Privacy. section).

A ‘package’ is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of
functionality.  A package contains a ‘Cargo.toml’ file that describes
how to build those crates.  Cargo is actually a package that contains
the binary crate for the command-line tool you've been using to build
your code.  The Cargo package also contains a library crate that the
binary crate depends on.  Other projects can depend on the Cargo library
crate to use the same logic the Cargo command-line tool uses.  A package
can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one
library crate.  A package must contain at least one crate, whether
that's a library or binary crate.

Let's walk through what happens when we create a package.  First we
enter the command ‘cargo new my-project’:

$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs

After we run ‘cargo new my-project’, we use ‘ls’ to see what Cargo
creates.  In the project directory, there's a ‘Cargo.toml’ file, giving
us a package.  There's also a ‘src’ directory that contains ‘main.rs’.
Open ‘Cargo.toml’ in your text editor, and note there's no mention of
‘src/main.rs’.  Cargo follows a convention that ‘src/main.rs’ is the
crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package.
Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory contains
‘src/lib.rs’, the package contains a library crate with the same name as
the package, and ‘src/lib.rs’ is its crate root.  Cargo passes the crate
root files to ‘rustc’ to build the library or binary.

Here, we have a package that only contains ‘src/main.rs’, meaning it
only contains a binary crate named ‘my-project’.  If a package contains
‘src/main.rs’ and ‘src/lib.rs’, it has two crates: a binary and a
library, both with the same name as the package.  A package can have
multiple binary crates by placing files in the ‘src/bin’ directory: each
file will be a separate binary crate.

10.1.1 Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy
----------------------------------------------------

In this section, we'll talk about modules and other parts of the module
system, namely ‘paths’, which allow you to name items; the ‘use’ keyword
that brings a path into scope; and the ‘pub’ keyword to make items
public.  We'll also discuss the ‘as’ keyword, external packages, and the
glob operator.

10.1.1.1 Modules Cheat Sheet
............................

Before we get to the details of modules and paths, here we provide a
quick reference on how modules, paths, the ‘use’ keyword, and the ‘pub’
keyword work in the compiler, and how most developers organize their
code.  We'll be going through examples of each of these rules throughout
this chapter, but this is a great place to refer to as a reminder of how
modules work.

   • *Start from the crate root*: When compiling a crate, the compiler
     first looks in the crate root file (usually ‘src/lib.rs’ for a
     library crate or ‘src/main.rs’ for a binary crate) for code to
     compile.
   • *Declaring modules*: In the crate root file, you can declare new
     modules; say you declare a “garden” module with ‘mod garden;’.  The
     compiler will look for the module's code in these places:
        • Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon
          following ‘mod garden’
        • In the file ‘src/garden.rs’
        • In the file ‘src/garden/mod.rs’

   • *Declaring submodules*: In any file other than the crate root, you
     can declare submodules.  For example, you might declare ‘mod
     vegetables;’ in ‘src/garden.rs’.  The compiler will look for the
     submodule's code within the directory named for the parent module
     in these places:
        • Inline, directly following ‘mod vegetables’, within curly
          brackets instead of the semicolon
        • In the file ‘src/garden/vegetables.rs’
        • In the file ‘src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs’

   • *Paths to code in modules*: Once a module is part of your crate,
     you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that
     same crate, as long as the privacy rules allow, using the path to
     the code.  For example, an ‘Asparagus’ type in the garden
     vegetables module would be found at
     ‘crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus’.
   • *Private vs.  public*: Code within a module is private from its
     parent modules by default.  To make a module public, declare it
     with ‘pub mod’ instead of ‘mod’.  To make items within a public
     module public as well, use ‘pub’ before their declarations.
   • *The ‘use’ keyword*: Within a scope, the ‘use’ keyword creates
     shortcuts to items to reduce repetition of long paths.  In any
     scope that can refer to ‘crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus’, you
     can create a shortcut with ‘use
     crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;’ and from then on you only
     need to write ‘Asparagus’ to make use of that type in the scope.

Here, we create a binary crate named ‘backyard’ that illustrates these
rules.  The crate's directory, also named ‘backyard’, contains these
files and directories:

backyard
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── garden
    │   └── vegetables.rs
    ├── garden.rs
    └── main.rs

The crate root file in this case is ‘src/main.rs’, and it contains:

use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;

pub mod garden;

fn main() {
    let plant = Asparagus {};
    println!("I'm growing {plant:?}!");
}

The ‘pub mod garden;’ line tells the compiler to include the code it
finds in ‘src/garden.rs’, which is:

pub mod vegetables;

Here, ‘pub mod vegetables;’ means the code in ‘src/garden/vegetables.rs’
is included too.  That code is:

pub struct Asparagus {}

Now let's get into the details of these rules and demonstrate them in
action!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Grouping Related Code in Modules,  Next: Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree,  Prev: Modules Cheat Sheet,  Up: Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy

10.1.1.2 Grouping Related Code in Modules
.........................................

‘Modules’ let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy
reuse.  Modules also allow us to control the ‘privacy’ of items because
code within a module is private by default.  Private items are internal
implementation details not available for outside use.  We can choose to
make modules and the items within them public, which exposes them to
allow external code to use and depend on them.

As an example, let's write a library crate that provides the
functionality of a restaurant.  We'll define the signatures of functions
but leave their bodies empty to concentrate on the organization of the
code rather than the implementation of a restaurant.

In the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to
as ‘front of house’ and others as ‘back of house’.  Front of house is
where customers are; this encompasses where the hosts seat customers,
servers take orders and payment, and bartenders make drinks.  Back of
house is where the chefs and cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers
clean up, and managers do administrative work.

To structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into
nested modules.  Create a new library named ‘restaurant’ by running
‘cargo new restaurant --lib’.  Then enter the code in Listing 7-1 into
‘src/lib.rs’ to define some modules and function signatures; this code
is the front of house section.

mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}

We define a module with the ‘mod’ keyword followed by the name of the
module (in this case, ‘front_of_house’).  The body of the module then
goes inside curly brackets.  Inside modules, we can place other modules,
as in this case with the modules ‘hosting’ and ‘serving’.  Modules can
also hold definitions for other items, such as structs, enums,
constants, traits, and--as in Listing 7-1--functions.

By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why
they're related.  Programmers using this code can navigate the code
based on the groups rather than having to read through all the
definitions, making it easier to find the definitions relevant to them.
Programmers adding new functionality to this code would know where to
place the code to keep the program organized.

Earlier, we mentioned that ‘src/main.rs’ and ‘src/lib.rs’ are called
crate roots.  The reason for their name is that the contents of either
of these two files form a module named ‘crate’ at the root of the
crate's module structure, known as the ‘module tree’.

Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.

crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment

This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside other modules; for
example, ‘hosting’ nests inside ‘front_of_house’.  The tree also shows
that some modules are ‘siblings’, meaning they're defined in the same
module; ‘hosting’ and ‘serving’ are siblings defined within
‘front_of_house’.  If module A is contained inside module B, we say that
module A is the ‘child’ of module B and that module B is the ‘parent’ of
module A. Notice that the entire module tree is rooted under the
implicit module named ‘crate’.

The module tree might remind you of the filesystem's directory tree on
your computer; this is a very apt comparison!  Just like directories in
a filesystem, you use modules to organize your code.  And just like
files in a directory, we need a way to find our modules.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree,  Next: Bringing Paths into Scope with the use Keyword,  Prev: Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy,  Up: Managing Growing Projects with Packages Crates and Modules

10.1.2 Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree
--------------------------------------------------------

To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in
the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem.  To call a
function, we need to know its path.

A path can take two forms:

   • An ‘absolute path’ is the full path starting from a crate root; for
     code from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the
     crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the
     literal ‘crate’.
   • A ‘relative path’ starts from the current module and uses ‘self’,
     ‘super’, or an identifier in the current module.

Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers
separated by double colons (‘::’).

Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the ‘add_to_waitlist’
function.  This is the same as asking: what's the path of the
‘add_to_waitlist’ function?  Listing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some
of the modules and functions removed.

We'll show two ways to call the ‘add_to_waitlist’ function from a new
function, ‘eat_at_restaurant’, defined in the crate root.  These paths
are correct, but there's another problem remaining that will prevent
this example from compiling as is.  We'll explain why in a bit.

The ‘eat_at_restaurant’ function is part of our library crate's public
API, so we mark it with the ‘pub’ keyword.  In the *note “Exposing Paths
with the ‘pub’ Keyword”: Exposing Paths with the pub Keyword. section,
we'll go into more detail about ‘pub’.

mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

The first time we call the ‘add_to_waitlist’ function in
‘eat_at_restaurant’, we use an absolute path.  The ‘add_to_waitlist’
function is defined in the same crate as ‘eat_at_restaurant’, which
means we can use the ‘crate’ keyword to start an absolute path.  We then
include each of the successive modules until we make our way to
‘add_to_waitlist’.  You can imagine a filesystem with the same
structure: we'd specify the path
‘/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist’ to run the ‘add_to_waitlist’
program; using the ‘crate’ name to start from the crate root is like
using ‘/’ to start from the filesystem root in your shell.

The second time we call ‘add_to_waitlist’ in ‘eat_at_restaurant’, we use
a relative path.  The path starts with ‘front_of_house’, the name of the
module defined at the same level of the module tree as
‘eat_at_restaurant’.  Here the filesystem equivalent would be using the
path ‘front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist’.  Starting with a module
name means that the path is relative.

Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you'll
make based on your project, and it depends on whether you're more likely
to move item definition code separately from or together with the code
that uses the item.  For example, if we moved the ‘front_of_house’
module and the ‘eat_at_restaurant’ function into a module named
‘customer_experience’, we'd need to update the absolute path to
‘add_to_waitlist’, but the relative path would still be valid.  However,
if we moved the ‘eat_at_restaurant’ function separately into a module
named ‘dining’, the absolute path to the ‘add_to_waitlist’ call would
stay the same, but the relative path would need to be updated.  Our
preference in general is to specify absolute paths because it's more
likely we'll want to move code definitions and item calls independently
of each other.

Let's try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won't compile yet!
The errors we get are shown in Listing 7-4.

error: could not compile `restaurant` (lib) due to 2 previous errors

The error messages say that module ‘hosting’ is private.  In other
words, we have the correct paths for the ‘hosting’ module and the
‘add_to_waitlist’ function, but Rust won't let us use them because it
doesn't have access to the private sections.  In Rust, all items
(functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private
to parent modules by default.  If you want to make an item like a
function or struct private, you put it in a module.

Items in a parent module can't use the private items inside child
modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor
modules.  This is because child modules wrap and hide their
implementation details, but the child modules can see the context in
which they're defined.  To continue with our metaphor, think of the
privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes
on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can
see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.

Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding
inner implementation details is the default.  That way, you know which
parts of the inner code you can change without breaking outer code.
However, Rust does give you the option to expose inner parts of child
modules' code to outer ancestor modules by using the ‘pub’ keyword to
make an item public.

10.1.2.1 Exposing Paths with the ‘pub’ Keyword
..............................................

Let's return to the error in Listing 7-4 that told us the ‘hosting’
module is private.  We want the ‘eat_at_restaurant’ function in the
parent module to have access to the ‘add_to_waitlist’ function in the
child module, so we mark the ‘hosting’ module with the ‘pub’ keyword, as
shown in Listing 7-5.

mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

Unfortunately, the code in Listing 7-5 still results in compiler errors,
as shown in Listing 7-6.

error: could not compile `restaurant` (lib) due to 2 previous errors

What happened?  Adding the ‘pub’ keyword in front of ‘mod hosting’ makes
the module public.  With this change, if we can access ‘front_of_house’,
we can access ‘hosting’.  But the ‘contents’ of ‘hosting’ are still
private; making the module public doesn't make its contents public.  The
‘pub’ keyword on a module only lets code in its ancestor modules refer
to it, not access its inner code.  Because modules are containers,
there's not much we can do by only making the module public; we need to
go further and choose to make one or more of the items within the module
public as well.

The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the ‘add_to_waitlist’ function is
private.  The privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and
methods as well as modules.

Let's also make the ‘add_to_waitlist’ function public by adding the
‘pub’ keyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.

mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

Now the code will compile!  To see why adding the ‘pub’ keyword lets us
use these paths in ‘eat_at_restaurant’ with respect to the privacy
rules, let's look at the absolute and the relative paths.

In the absolute path, we start with ‘crate’, the root of our crate's
module tree.  The ‘front_of_house’ module is defined in the crate root.
While ‘front_of_house’ isn't public, because the ‘eat_at_restaurant’
function is defined in the same module as ‘front_of_house’ (that is,
‘eat_at_restaurant’ and ‘front_of_house’ are siblings), we can refer to
‘front_of_house’ from ‘eat_at_restaurant’.  Next is the ‘hosting’ module
marked with ‘pub’.  We can access the parent module of ‘hosting’, so we
can access ‘hosting’.  Finally, the ‘add_to_waitlist’ function is marked
with ‘pub’ and we can access its parent module, so this function call
works!

In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except
for the first step: rather than starting from the crate root, the path
starts from ‘front_of_house’.  The ‘front_of_house’ module is defined
within the same module as ‘eat_at_restaurant’, so the relative path
starting from the module in which ‘eat_at_restaurant’ is defined works.
Then, because ‘hosting’ and ‘add_to_waitlist’ are marked with ‘pub’, the
rest of the path works, and this function call is valid!

If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your
code, your public API is your contract with users of your crate that
determines how they can interact with your code.  There are many
considerations around managing changes to your public API to make it
easier for people to depend on your crate.  These considerations are out
of the scope of this book; if you're interested in this topic, see The
Rust API Guidelines (https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).

Best Practices for Packages with a Binary and a Library We mentioned
that a package can contain both a ‘src/main.rs’ binary crate root as
well as a ‘src/lib.rs’ library crate root, and both crates will have the
package name by default.  Typically, packages with this pattern of
containing both a library and a binary crate will have just enough code
in the binary crate to start an executable that calls code within the
library crate.  This lets other projects benefit from most of the
functionality that the package provides because the library crate's code
can be shared.

The module tree should be defined in ‘src/lib.rs’.  Then, any public
items can be used in the binary crate by starting paths with the name of
the package.  The binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just
like a completely external crate would use the library crate: it can
only use the public API. This helps you design a good API; not only are
you the author, you're also a client!

In *note Chapter 12: An I/O Project Building a Command Line Program,
we'll demonstrate this organizational practice with a command-line
program that will contain both a binary crate and a library crate.

10.1.2.2 Starting Relative Paths with ‘super’
.............................................

We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather
than the current module or the crate root, by using ‘super’ at the start
of the path.  This is like starting a filesystem path with the ‘..’
syntax.  Using ‘super’ allows us to reference an item that we know is in
the parent module, which can make rearranging the module tree easier
when the module is closely related to the parent but the parent might be
moved elsewhere in the module tree someday.

Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a
chef fixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the
customer.  The function ‘fix_incorrect_order’ defined in the
‘back_of_house’ module calls the function ‘deliver_order’ defined in the
parent module by specifying the path to ‘deliver_order’, starting with
‘super’.

fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}

The ‘fix_incorrect_order’ function is in the ‘back_of_house’ module, so
we can use ‘super’ to go to the parent module of ‘back_of_house’, which
in this case is ‘crate’, the root.  From there, we look for
‘deliver_order’ and find it.  Success!  We think the ‘back_of_house’
module and the ‘deliver_order’ function are likely to stay in the same
relationship to each other and get moved together should we decide to
reorganize the crate's module tree.  Therefore, we used ‘super’ so we'll
have fewer places to update code in the future if this code gets moved
to a different module.

10.1.2.3 Making Structs and Enums Public
........................................

We can also use ‘pub’ to designate structs and enums as public, but
there are a few extra details to the usage of ‘pub’ with structs and
enums.  If we use ‘pub’ before a struct definition, we make the struct
public, but the struct's fields will still be private.  We can make each
field public or not on a case-by-case basis.  In Listing 7-9, we've
defined a public ‘back_of_house::Breakfast’ struct with a public ‘toast’
field but a private ‘seasonal_fruit’ field.  This models the case in a
restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that comes with
a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based on
what's in season and in stock.  The available fruit changes quickly, so
customers can't choose the fruit or even see which fruit they'll get.

mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
    meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
    println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");
}

Because the ‘toast’ field in the ‘back_of_house::Breakfast’ struct is
public, in ‘eat_at_restaurant’ we can write and read to the ‘toast’
field using dot notation.  Notice that we can't use the ‘seasonal_fruit’
field in ‘eat_at_restaurant’, because ‘seasonal_fruit’ is private.  Try
uncommenting the line modifying the ‘seasonal_fruit’ field value to see
what error you get!

Also, note that because ‘back_of_house::Breakfast’ has a private field,
the struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs
an instance of ‘Breakfast’ (we've named it ‘summer’ here).  If
‘Breakfast’ didn't have such a function, we couldn't create an instance
of ‘Breakfast’ in ‘eat_at_restaurant’ because we couldn't set the value
of the private ‘seasonal_fruit’ field in ‘eat_at_restaurant’.

In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then
public.  We only need the ‘pub’ before the ‘enum’ keyword, as shown in
Listing 7-10.

mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}

Because we made the ‘Appetizer’ enum public, we can use the ‘Soup’ and
‘Salad’ variants in ‘eat_at_restaurant’.

Enums aren't very useful unless their variants are public; it would be
annoying to have to annotate all enum variants with ‘pub’ in every case,
so the default for enum variants is to be public.  Structs are often
useful without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the
general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated
with ‘pub’.

There's one more situation involving ‘pub’ that we haven't covered, and
that is our last module system feature: the ‘use’ keyword.  We'll cover
‘use’ by itself first, and then we'll show how to combine ‘pub’ and
‘use’.

10.1.3 Bringing Paths into Scope with the ‘use’ Keyword
-------------------------------------------------------

Having to write out the paths to call functions can feel inconvenient
and repetitive.  In Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or
relative path to the ‘add_to_waitlist’ function, every time we wanted to
call ‘add_to_waitlist’ we had to specify ‘front_of_house’ and ‘hosting’
too.  Fortunately, there's a way to simplify this process: we can create
a shortcut to a path with the ‘use’ keyword once, and then use the
shorter name everywhere else in the scope.

In Listing 7-11, we bring the ‘crate::front_of_house::hosting’ module
into the scope of the ‘eat_at_restaurant’ function so we only have to
specify ‘hosting::add_to_waitlist’ to call the ‘add_to_waitlist’
function in ‘eat_at_restaurant’.

mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

Adding ‘use’ and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic
link in the filesystem.  By adding ‘use crate::front_of_house::hosting’
in the crate root, ‘hosting’ is now a valid name in that scope, just as
though the ‘hosting’ module had been defined in the crate root.  Paths
brought into scope with ‘use’ also check privacy, like any other paths.

Note that ‘use’ only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in
which the ‘use’ occurs.  Listing 7-12 moves the ‘eat_at_restaurant’
function into a new child module named ‘customer’, which is then a
different scope than the ‘use’ statement, so the function body won't
compile.

mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}

The compiler error shows that the shortcut no longer applies within the
‘customer’ module:

Notice there's also a warning that the ‘use’ is no longer used in its

too, or reference the shortcut in the parent module with
‘super::hosting’ within the child ‘customer’ module.

10.1.3.1 Creating Idiomatic ‘use’ Paths
.......................................

In Listing 7-11, you might have wondered why we specified ‘use
crate::front_of_house::hosting’ and then called
‘hosting::add_to_waitlist’ in ‘eat_at_restaurant’, rather than
specifying the ‘use’ path all the way out to the ‘add_to_waitlist’
function to achieve the same result, as in Listing 7-13.

mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist();
}

Although both Listing 7-11 and Listing 7-13 accomplish the same task,
Listing 7-11 is the idiomatic way to bring a function into scope with
‘use’.  Bringing the function's parent module into scope with ‘use’
means we have to specify the parent module when calling the function.
Specifying the parent module when calling the function makes it clear
that the function isn't locally defined while still minimizing
repetition of the full path.  The code in Listing 7-13 is unclear as to
where ‘add_to_waitlist’ is defined.

On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with
‘use’, it's idiomatic to specify the full path.  Listing 7-14 shows the
idiomatic way to bring the standard library's ‘HashMap’ struct into the
scope of a binary crate.

use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}

There's no strong reason behind this idiom: it's just the convention
that has emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust
code this way.

The exception to this idiom is if we're bringing two items with the same
name into scope with ‘use’ statements, because Rust doesn't allow that.
Listing 7-15 shows how to bring two ‘Result’ types into scope that have
the same name but different parent modules, and how to refer to them.

use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
    // --snip--
}

As you can see, using the parent modules distinguishes the two ‘Result’
types.  If instead we specified ‘use std::fmt::Result’ and ‘use
std::io::Result’, we'd have two ‘Result’ types in the same scope, and
Rust wouldn't know which one we meant when we used ‘Result’.

10.1.3.2 Providing New Names with the ‘as’ Keyword
..................................................

There's another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the
same name into the same scope with ‘use’: after the path, we can specify
‘as’ and a new local name, or ‘alias’, for the type.  Listing 7-16 shows
another way to write the code in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two
‘Result’ types using ‘as’.

use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}

In the second ‘use’ statement, we chose the new name ‘IoResult’ for the
‘std::io::Result’ type, which won't conflict with the ‘Result’ from
‘std::fmt’ that we've also brought into scope.  Listing 7-15 and Listing
7-16 are considered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Re-exporting Names with pub use,  Next: Using External Packages,  Prev: Providing New Names with the as Keyword,  Up: Bringing Paths into Scope with the use Keyword

10.1.3.3 Re-exporting Names with ‘pub use’
..........................................

When we bring a name into scope with the ‘use’ keyword, the name
available in the new scope is private.  To enable the code that calls
our code to refer to that name as if it had been defined in that code's
scope, we can combine ‘pub’ and ‘use’.  This technique is called
‘re-exporting’ because we're bringing an item into scope but also making
that item available for others to bring into their scope.

Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with ‘use’ in the root
module changed to ‘pub use’.

mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

Before this change, external code would have to call the
‘add_to_waitlist’ function by using the path
‘restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist()’, which also
would have required the ‘front_of_house’ module to be marked as ‘pub’.
Now that this ‘pub use’ has re-exported the ‘hosting’ module from the
root module, external code can use the path
‘restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()’ instead.

Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is
different from how programmers calling your code would think about the
domain.  For example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running
the restaurant think about “front of house” and “back of house.” But
customers visiting a restaurant probably won't think about the parts of
the restaurant in those terms.  With ‘pub use’, we can write our code
with one structure but expose a different structure.  Doing so makes our
library well organized for programmers working on the library and
programmers calling the library.  We'll look at another example of ‘pub
use’ and how it affects your crate's documentation in the *note
“Exporting a Convenient Public API with ‘pub use’”: Exporting a
Convenient Public API with pub use. section of Chapter 14.

10.1.3.4 Using External Packages
................................

In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an
external package called ‘rand’ to get random numbers.  To use ‘rand’ in
our project, we added this line to ‘Cargo.toml’:

rand = "0.8.5"

Adding ‘rand’ as a dependency in ‘Cargo.toml’ tells Cargo to download
the ‘rand’ package and any dependencies from cratesio
(https://crates.io/) and make ‘rand’ available to our project.

Then, to bring ‘rand’ definitions into the scope of our package, we
added a ‘use’ line starting with the name of the crate, ‘rand’, and
listed the items we wanted to bring into scope.  Recall that in the
*note “Generating a Random Number”: Generating a Random Number. section
in Chapter 2, we brought the ‘Rng’ trait into scope and called the
‘rand::thread_rng’ function:

use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
}

Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at
cratesio (https://crates.io/), and pulling any of them into your package
involves these same steps: listing them in your package's ‘Cargo.toml’
file and using ‘use’ to bring items from their crates into scope.

Note that the standard ‘std’ library is also a crate that's external to
our package.  Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust
language, we don't need to change ‘Cargo.toml’ to include ‘std’.  But we
do need to refer to it with ‘use’ to bring items from there into our
package's scope.  For example, with ‘HashMap’ we would use this line:

use std::collections::HashMap;

This is an absolute path starting with ‘std’, the name of the standard
library crate.

10.1.3.5 Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large ‘use’ Lists
.........................................................

If we're using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module,
listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in
our files.  For example, these two ‘use’ statements we had in the
guessing game in Listing 2-4 bring items from ‘std’ into scope:

// --snip--
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// --snip--

Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in
one line.  We do this by specifying the common part of the path,
followed by two colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the
parts of the paths that differ, as shown in Listing 7-18.

// --snip--
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
// --snip--

In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate
or module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate ‘use’
statements needed by a lot!

We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when
combining two ‘use’ statements that share a subpath.  For example,
Listing 7-19 shows two ‘use’ statements: one that brings ‘std::io’ into
scope and one that brings ‘std::io::Write’ into scope.

use std::io;
use std::io::Write;

The common part of these two paths is ‘std::io’, and that's the complete
first path.  To merge these two paths into one ‘use’ statement, we can
use ‘self’ in the nested path, as shown in Listing 7-20.

use std::io::{self, Write};

This line brings ‘std::io’ and ‘std::io::Write’ into scope.

10.1.3.6 The Glob Operator
..........................

If we want to bring ‘all’ public items defined in a path into scope, we
can specify that path followed by the ‘*’ glob operator:

use std::collections::*;

This ‘use’ statement brings all public items defined in
‘std::collections’ into the current scope.  Be careful when using the
glob operator!  Glob can make it harder to tell what names are in scope
and where a name used in your program was defined.

The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under
test into the ‘tests’ module; we'll talk about that in the *note “How to
Write Tests”: How to Write Tests. section in Chapter 11.  The glob
operator is also sometimes used as part of the prelude pattern: see the
standard library documentation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/prelude/index.html) for more
information on that pattern.

10.1.4 Separating Modules into Different Files
----------------------------------------------

So far, all the examples in this chapter defined multiple modules in one
file.  When modules get large, you might want to move their definitions
to a separate file to make the code easier to navigate.

For example, let's start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple
restaurant modules.  We'll extract modules into files instead of having
all the modules defined in the crate root file.  In this case, the crate
root file is ‘src/lib.rs’, but this procedure also works with binary
crates whose crate root file is ‘src/main.rs’.

First we'll extract the ‘front_of_house’ module to its own file.  Remove
the code inside the curly brackets for the ‘front_of_house’ module,
leaving only the ‘mod front_of_house;’ declaration, so that ‘src/lib.rs’
contains the code shown in Listing 7-21.  Note that this won't compile
until we create the ‘src/front_of_house.rs’ file in Listing 7-22.

mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

Next, place the code that was in the curly brackets into a new file
named ‘src/front_of_house.rs’, as shown in Listing 7-22.  The compiler
knows to look in this file because it came across the module declaration
in the crate root with the name ‘front_of_house’.

pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}

Note that you only need to load a file using a ‘mod’ declaration ‘once’
in your module tree.  Once the compiler knows the file is part of the
project (and knows where in the module tree the code resides because of
where you've put the ‘mod’ statement), other files in your project
should refer to the loaded file's code using a path to where it was
declared, as covered in the *note “Paths for Referring to an Item in the
Module Tree”: Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree.
section.  In other words, ‘mod’ is ‘not’ an “include” operation that you
may have seen in other programming languages.

Next, we'll extract the ‘hosting’ module to its own file.  The process
is a bit different because ‘hosting’ is a child module of
‘front_of_house’, not of the root module.  We'll place the file for
‘hosting’ in a new directory that will be named for its ancestors in the
module tree, in this case ‘src/front_of_house’.

To start moving ‘hosting’, we change ‘src/front_of_house.rs’ to contain
only the declaration of the ‘hosting’ module:

pub mod hosting;

Then we create a ‘src/front_of_house’ directory and a ‘hosting.rs’ file
to contain the definitions made in the ‘hosting’ module:

pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}

If we instead put ‘hosting.rs’ in the ‘src’ directory, the compiler
would expect the ‘hosting.rs’ code to be in a ‘hosting’ module declared
in the crate root, and not declared as a child of the ‘front_of_house’
module.  The compiler's rules for which files to check for which
modules' code mean the directories and files more closely match the
module tree.

* Alternate File Paths::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Alternate File Paths,  Next: Summary 7,  Prev: Separating Modules into Different Files,  Up: Separating Modules into Different Files

10.1.4.1 Alternate File Paths
.............................

So far we've covered the most idiomatic file paths the Rust compiler
uses, but Rust also supports an older style of file path.  For a module
named ‘front_of_house’ declared in the crate root, the compiler will
look for the module's code in:

   • ‘src/front_of_house.rs’ (what we covered)
   • ‘src/front_of_house/mod.rs’ (older style, still supported path)

For a module named ‘hosting’ that is a submodule of ‘front_of_house’,
the compiler will look for the module's code in:

   • ‘src/front_of_house/hosting.rs’ (what we covered)
   • ‘src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs’ (older style, still supported
     path)

If you use both styles for the same module, you'll get a compiler error.
Using a mix of both styles for different modules in the same project is
allowed, but might be confusing for people navigating your project.

The main downside to the style that uses files named ‘mod.rs’ is that
your project can end up with many files named ‘mod.rs’, which can get
confusing when you have them open in your editor at the same time.

We've moved each module's code to a separate file, and the module tree
remains the same.  The function calls in ‘eat_at_restaurant’ will work
without any modification, even though the definitions live in different
files.  This technique lets you move modules to new files as they grow
in size.

Note that the ‘pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting’ statement in
‘src/lib.rs’ also hasn't changed, nor does ‘use’ have any impact on what
files are compiled as part of the crate.  The ‘mod’ keyword declares
modules, and Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for
the code that goes into that module.

10.1.5 Summary
--------------

Rust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into
modules so you can refer to items defined in one module from another
module.  You can do this by specifying absolute or relative paths.
These paths can be brought into scope with a ‘use’ statement so you can
use a shorter path for multiple uses of the item in that scope.  Module
code is private by default, but you can make definitions public by
adding the ‘pub’ keyword.

In the next chapter, we'll look at some collection data structures in
the standard library that you can use in your neatly organized code.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Common Collections,  Next: Error Handling,  Prev: Managing Growing Projects with Packages Crates and Modules,  Up: Top

11 Common Collections
*********************

Rust's standard library includes a number of very useful data structures
called ‘collections’.  Most other data types represent one specific
value, but collections can contain multiple values.  Unlike the built-in
array and tuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on
the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at
compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.  Each kind of
collection has different capabilities and costs, and choosing an
appropriate one for your current situation is a skill you'll develop
over time.  In this chapter, we'll discuss three collections that are
used very often in Rust programs:

   • A ‘vector’ allows you to store a variable number of values next to
     each other.
   • A ‘string’ is a collection of characters.  We've mentioned the
     ‘String’ type previously, but in this chapter we'll talk about it
     in depth.
   • A ‘hash map’ allows you to associate a value with a specific key.
     It's a particular implementation of the more general data structure
     called a ‘map’.

To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard
library, see the documentation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/collections/index.html).

We'll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps,
as well as what makes each special.

11.1 Storing Lists of Values with Vectors
=========================================

The first collection type we'll look at is ‘Vec<T>’, also known as a
‘vector’.  Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single
data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory.
Vectors can only store values of the same type.  They are useful when
you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the
prices of items in a shopping cart.

11.1.1 Creating a New Vector
----------------------------

To create a new empty vector, we call the ‘Vec::new’ function, as shown
in Listing 8-1.

    let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

Note that we added a type annotation here.  Because we aren't inserting
any values into this vector, Rust doesn't know what kind of elements we
intend to store.  This is an important point.  Vectors are implemented
using generics; we'll cover how to use generics with your own types in
Chapter 10.  For now, know that the ‘Vec<T>’ type provided by the
standard library can hold any type.  When we create a vector to hold a
specific type, we can specify the type within angle brackets.  In
Listing 8-1, we've told Rust that the ‘Vec<T>’ in ‘v’ will hold elements
of the ‘i32’ type.

More often, you'll create a ‘Vec<T>’ with initial values and Rust will
infer the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this
type annotation.  Rust conveniently provides the ‘vec!’ macro, which
will create a new vector that holds the values you give it.  Listing 8-2
creates a new ‘Vec<i32>’ that holds the values ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’.  The
integer type is ‘i32’ because that's the default integer type, as we
discussed in the *note “Data Types”: Data Types. section of Chapter 3.

    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

Because we've given initial ‘i32’ values, Rust can infer that the type
of ‘v’ is ‘Vec<i32>’, and the type annotation isn't necessary.  Next,
we'll look at how to modify a vector.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Updating a Vector,  Next: Reading Elements of Vectors,  Prev: Creating a New Vector,  Up: Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

11.1.1.1 Updating a Vector
..........................

To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the ‘push’
method, as shown in Listing 8-3.

    let mut v = Vec::new();

    v.push(5);
    v.push(6);
    v.push(7);
    v.push(8);

As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need
to make it mutable using the ‘mut’ keyword, as discussed in Chapter 3.
The numbers we place inside are all of type ‘i32’, and Rust infers this
from the data, so we don't need the ‘Vec<i32>’ annotation.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Reading Elements of Vectors,  Next: Iterating Over the Values in a Vector,  Prev: Updating a Vector,  Up: Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

11.1.1.2 Reading Elements of Vectors
....................................

There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing
or by using the ‘get’ method.  In the following examples, we've
annotated the types of the values that are returned from these functions
for extra clarity.

Listing 8-4 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, with
indexing syntax and the ‘get’ method.

    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &i32 = &v[2];
    println!("The third element is {third}");

    let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
    match third {
        Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
        None => println!("There is no third element."),
    }

Note a few details here.  We use the index value of ‘2’ to get the third
element because vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero.  Using
‘&’ and ‘[]’ gives us a reference to the element at the index value.
When we use the ‘get’ method with the index passed as an argument, we
get an ‘Option<&T>’ that we can use with ‘match’.

Rust provides these two ways to reference an element so you can choose
how the program behaves when you try to use an index value outside the
range of existing elements.  As an example, let's see what happens when
we have a vector of five elements and then we try to access an element
at index 100 with each technique, as shown in Listing 8-5.

    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let does_not_exist = &v[100];
    let does_not_exist = v.get(100);

When we run this code, the first ‘[]’ method will cause the program to
panic because it references a nonexistent element.  This method is best
used when you want your program to crash if there's an attempt to access
an element past the end of the vector.

When the ‘get’ method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it
returns ‘None’ without panicking.  You would use this method if
accessing an element beyond the range of the vector may happen
occasionally under normal circumstances.  Your code will then have logic
to handle having either ‘Some(&element)’ or ‘None’, as discussed in
Chapter 6.  For example, the index could be coming from a person
entering a number.  If they accidentally enter a number that's too large
and the program gets a ‘None’ value, you could tell the user how many
items are in the current vector and give them another chance to enter a
valid value.  That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program
due to a typo!

When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this
reference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain
valid.  Recall the rule that states you can't have mutable and immutable
references in the same scope.  That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where
we hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try
to add an element to the end.  This program won't work if we also try to
refer to that element later in the function.

    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &v[0];

    v.push(6);

    println!("The first element is: {first}");

Compiling this code will result in this error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:5
  |
4 |     let first = &v[0];
  |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |
6 |     v.push(6);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 |     println!("The first element is: {first}");
  |                                     ------- immutable borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `collections` (bin "collections") due to 1 previous error

The code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: why should a
reference to the first element care about changes at the end of the
vector?  This error is due to the way vectors work: because vectors put
the values next to each other in memory, adding a new element onto the
end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the
old elements to the new space, if there isn't enough room to put all the
elements next to each other where the vector is currently stored.  In
that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to
deallocated memory.  The borrowing rules prevent programs from ending up
in that situation.

Note: For more on the implementation details of the ‘Vec<T>’ type, see
“The Rustonomicon”
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../nomicon/vec/vec.html).

11.1.1.3 Iterating Over the Values in a Vector
..............................................

To access each element in a vector in turn, we would iterate through all
of the elements rather than use indices to access one at a time.
Listing 8-7 shows how to use a ‘for’ loop to get immutable references to
each element in a vector of ‘i32’ values and print them.

    let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &v {
        println!("{i}");
    }

We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable
vector in order to make changes to all the elements.  The ‘for’ loop in
Listing 8-8 will add ‘50’ to each element.

    let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &mut v {
        *i += 50;
    }

To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use
the ‘*’ dereference operator to get to the value in ‘i’ before we can
use the ‘+=’ operator.  We'll talk more about the dereference operator
in the *note “Following the Pointer to the Value with the Dereference
Operator”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch15-02-derefmd__following-the-pointer-to-the-value-with-the-dereference-operator.
section of Chapter 15.

Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because
of the borrow checker's rules.  If we attempted to insert or remove
items in the ‘for’ loop bodies in Listing 8-7 and Listing 8-8, we would
get a compiler error similar to the one we got with the code in Listing
8-6.  The reference to the vector that the ‘for’ loop holds prevents
simultaneous modification of the whole vector.

11.1.1.4 Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types
..............................................

Vectors can only store values that are of the same type.  This can be
inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list
of items of different types.  Fortunately, the variants of an enum are
defined under the same enum type, so when we need one type to represent
elements of different types, we can define and use an enum!

For example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in
which some of the columns in the row contain integers, some
floating-point numbers, and some strings.  We can define an enum whose
variants will hold the different value types, and all the enum variants
will be considered the same type: that of the enum.  Then we can create
a vector to hold that enum and so, ultimately, hold different types.
We've demonstrated this in Listing 8-9.

    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),
        Float(f64),
        Text(String),
    }

    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
    ];

Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so
it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store
each element.  We must also be explicit about what types are allowed in
this vector.  If Rust allowed a vector to hold any type, there would be
a chance that one or more of the types would cause errors with the
operations performed on the elements of the vector.  Using an enum plus
a ‘match’ expression means that Rust will ensure at compile time that
every possible case is handled, as discussed in Chapter 6.

If you don't know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at
runtime to store in a vector, the enum technique won't work.  Instead,
you can use a trait object, which we'll cover in Chapter 18.

Now that we've discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, be
sure to review the API documentation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/vec/struct.Vec.html) for all of
the many useful methods defined on ‘Vec<T>’ by the standard library.
For example, in addition to ‘push’, a ‘pop’ method removes and returns
the last element.

11.1.1.5 Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements
.............................................

Like any other ‘struct’, a vector is freed when it goes out of scope, as
annotated in Listing 8-10.

    {
        let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

        // do stuff with v
    } // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here

When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped,
meaning the integers it holds will be cleaned up.  The borrow checker
ensures that any references to contents of a vector are only used while
the vector itself is valid.

Let's move on to the next collection type: ‘String’!

11.1.2 Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings
----------------------------------------------

We talked about strings in Chapter 4, but we'll look at them in more
depth now.  New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings for a
combination of three reasons: Rust's propensity for exposing possible
errors, strings being a more complicated data structure than many
programmers give them credit for, and UTF-8.  These factors combine in a
way that can seem difficult when you're coming from other programming
languages.

We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are
implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide
useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text.  In this
section, we'll talk about the operations on ‘String’ that every
collection type has, such as creating, updating, and reading.  We'll
also discuss the ways in which ‘String’ is different from the other
collections, namely how indexing into a ‘String’ is complicated by the
differences between how people and computers interpret ‘String’ data.

11.1.2.1 What Is a String?
..........................

We'll first define what we mean by the term ‘string’.  Rust has only one
string type in the core language, which is the string slice ‘str’ that
is usually seen in its borrowed form ‘&str’.  In Chapter 4, we talked
about ‘string slices’, which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string
data stored elsewhere.  String literals, for example, are stored in the
program's binary and are therefore string slices.

The ‘String’ type, which is provided by Rust's standard library rather
than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8
encoded string type.  When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they
might be referring to either the ‘String’ or the string slice ‘&str’
types, not just one of those types.  Although this section is largely
about ‘String’, both types are used heavily in Rust's standard library,
and both ‘String’ and string slices are UTF-8 encoded.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Creating a New String,  Next: Updating a String,  Prev: What Is a String?,  Up: Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

11.1.2.2 Creating a New String
..............................

Many of the same operations available with ‘Vec<T>’ are available with
‘String’ as well because ‘String’ is actually implemented as a wrapper
around a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and
capabilities.  An example of a function that works the same way with
‘Vec<T>’ and ‘String’ is the ‘new’ function to create an instance, shown
in Listing 8-11.

    let mut s = String::new();

This line creates a new, empty string called ‘s’, into which we can then
load data.  Often, we'll have some initial data with which we want to
start the string.  For that, we use the ‘to_string’ method, which is
available on any type that implements the ‘Display’ trait, as string
literals do.  Listing 8-12 shows two examples.

    let data = "initial contents";

    let s = data.to_string();

    // the method also works on a literal directly:
    let s = "initial contents".to_string();

This code creates a string containing ‘initial contents’.

We can also use the function ‘String::from’ to create a ‘String’ from a
string literal.  The code in Listing 8-13 is equivalent to the code in
Listing 8-12 that uses ‘to_string’.

    let s = String::from("initial contents");

Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different
generic APIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options.  Some of
them can seem redundant, but they all have their place!  In this case,
‘String::from’ and ‘to_string’ do the same thing, so which one you
choose is a matter of style and readability.

Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly
encoded data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.

    let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
    let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
    let hello = String::from("Hello");
    let hello = String::from("שלום");
    let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
    let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
    let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
    let hello = String::from("你好");
    let hello = String::from("Olá");
    let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
    let hello = String::from("Hola");

All of these are valid ‘String’ values.

11.1.2.3 Updating a String
..........................

A ‘String’ can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the
contents of a ‘Vec<T>’, if you push more data into it.  In addition, you
can conveniently use the ‘+’ operator or the ‘format!’ macro to
concatenate ‘String’ values.  Appending to a String with ‘push_str’ and
‘push’ We can grow a ‘String’ by using the ‘push_str’ method to append a
string slice, as shown in Listing 8-15.

    let mut s = String::from("foo");
    s.push_str("bar");

After these two lines, ‘s’ will contain ‘foobar’.  The ‘push_str’ method
takes a string slice because we don't necessarily want to take ownership
of the parameter.  For example, in the code in Listing 8-16, we want to
be able to use ‘s2’ after appending its contents to ‘s1’.

    let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
    let s2 = "bar";
    s1.push_str(s2);
    println!("s2 is {s2}");

If the ‘push_str’ method took ownership of ‘s2’, we wouldn't be able to
print its value on the last line.  However, this code works as we'd
expect!

The ‘push’ method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to
the ‘String’.  Listing 8-17 adds the letter ‘l’ to a ‘String’ using the
‘push’ method.

    let mut s = String::from("lo");
    s.push('l');

As a result, ‘s’ will contain ‘lol’.  Concatenation with the ‘+’
Operator or the ‘format!’ Macro Often, you'll want to combine two
existing strings.  One way to do so is to use the ‘+’ operator, as shown
in Listing 8-18.

    let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
    let s2 = String::from("world!");
    let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used

The string ‘s3’ will contain ‘Hello, world!’.  The reason ‘s1’ is no
longer valid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to
‘s2’, has to do with the signature of the method that's called when we
use the ‘+’ operator.  The ‘+’ operator uses the ‘add’ method, whose
signature looks something like this:

fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {

In the standard library, you'll see ‘add’ defined using generics and
associated types.  Here, we've substituted in concrete types, which is
what happens when we call this method with ‘String’ values.  We'll
discuss generics in Chapter 10.  This signature gives us the clues we
need in order to understand the tricky bits of the ‘+’ operator.

First, ‘s2’ has an ‘&’, meaning that we're adding a ‘reference’ of the
second string to the first string.  This is because of the ‘s’ parameter
in the ‘add’ function: we can only add a ‘&str’ to a ‘String’; we can't
add two ‘String’ values together.  But wait--the type of ‘&s2’ is
‘&String’, not ‘&str’, as specified in the second parameter to ‘add’.
So why does Listing 8-18 compile?

The reason we're able to use ‘&s2’ in the call to ‘add’ is that the
compiler can ‘coerce’ the ‘&String’ argument into a ‘&str’.  When we
call the ‘add’ method, Rust uses a ‘deref coercion’, which here turns
‘&s2’ into ‘&s2[..]’.  We'll discuss deref coercion in more depth in
Chapter 15.  Because ‘add’ does not take ownership of the ‘s’ parameter,
‘s2’ will still be a valid ‘String’ after this operation.

Second, we can see in the signature that ‘add’ takes ownership of ‘self’
because ‘self’ does ‘not’ have an ‘&’.  This means ‘s1’ in Listing 8-18
will be moved into the ‘add’ call and will no longer be valid after
that.  So, although ‘let s3 = s1 + &s2;’ looks like it will copy both
strings and create a new one, this statement actually takes ownership of
‘s1’, appends a copy of the contents of ‘s2’, and then returns ownership
of the result.  In other words, it looks like it's making a lot of
copies, but it isn't; the implementation is more efficient than copying.

If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the ‘+’
operator gets unwieldy:

    let s1 = String::from("tic");
    let s2 = String::from("tac");
    let s3 = String::from("toe");

    let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;

At this point, ‘s’ will be ‘tic-tac-toe’.  With all of the ‘+’ and ‘"’
characters, it's difficult to see what's going on.  For combining
strings in more complicated ways, we can instead use the ‘format!’
macro:

    let s1 = String::from("tic");
    let s2 = String::from("tac");
    let s3 = String::from("toe");

    let s = format!("{s1}-{s2}-{s3}");

This code also sets ‘s’ to ‘tic-tac-toe’.  The ‘format!’ macro works
like ‘println!’, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it
returns a ‘String’ with the contents.  The version of the code using
‘format!’ is much easier to read, and the code generated by the
‘format!’ macro uses references so that this call doesn't take ownership
of any of its parameters.

11.1.2.4 Indexing into Strings
..............................

In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in
a string by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation.
However, if you try to access parts of a ‘String’ using indexing syntax
in Rust, you'll get an error.  Consider the invalid code in Listing
8-19.

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let h = s1[0];

This code will result in the following error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)

error: could not compile `collections` (bin "collections") due to 1 previous error

The error and the note tell the story: Rust strings don't support
indexing.  But why not?  To answer that question, we need to discuss how
Rust stores strings in memory.  Internal Representation A ‘String’ is a
wrapper over a ‘Vec<u8>’.  Let's look at some of our properly encoded
UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14.  First, this one:

    let hello = String::from("Hola");

In this case, ‘len’ will be ‘4’, which means the vector storing the
string ‘"Hola"’ is 4 bytes long.  Each of these letters takes one byte
when encoded in UTF-8.  The following line, however, may surprise you
(note that this string begins with the capital Cyrillic letter ‘Ze’, not
the number 3):

    let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");

If you were asked how long the string is, you might say 12.  In fact,
Rust's answer is 24: that's the number of bytes it takes to encode
“Здравствуйте” in UTF-8, because each Unicode scalar value in that
string takes 2 bytes of storage.  Therefore, an index into the string's
bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode scalar value.  To
demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust code:

let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let answer = &hello[0];

You already know that ‘answer’ will not be ‘З’, the first letter.  When
encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of ‘З’ is ‘208’ and the second is
‘151’, so it would seem that ‘answer’ should in fact be ‘208’, but ‘208’
is not a valid character on its own.  Returning ‘208’ is likely not what
a user would want if they asked for the first letter of this string;
however, that's the only data that Rust has at byte index 0.  Users
generally don't want the byte value returned, even if the string
contains only Latin letters: if ‘&"hi"[0]’ were valid code that returned
the byte value, it would return ‘104’, not ‘h’.

The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and
causing bugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn't
compile this code at all and prevents misunderstandings early in the
development process.  Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters!  Oh
My!  Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant
ways to look at strings from Rust's perspective: as bytes, scalar
values, and grapheme clusters (the closest thing to what we would call
‘letters’).

If we look at the Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, it
is stored as a vector of ‘u8’ values that looks like this:

[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]

That's 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data.  If we
look at them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust's ‘char’ type
is, those bytes look like this:

['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']

There are six ‘char’ values here, but the fourth and sixth are not
letters: they're diacritics that don't make sense on their own.
Finally, if we look at them as grapheme clusters, we'd get what a person
would call the four letters that make up the Hindi word:

["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]

Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that
computers store so that each program can choose the interpretation it
needs, no matter what human language the data is in.

A final reason Rust doesn't allow us to index into a ‘String’ to get a
character is that indexing operations are expected to always take
constant time (O(1)).  But it isn't possible to guarantee that
performance with a ‘String’, because Rust would have to walk through the
contents from the beginning to the index to determine how many valid
characters there were.

11.1.2.5 Slicing Strings
........................

Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it's not clear what
the return type of the string-indexing operation should be: a byte
value, a character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice.  If you
really need to use indices to create string slices, therefore, Rust asks
you to be more specific.

Rather than indexing using ‘[]’ with a single number, you can use ‘[]’
with a range to create a string slice containing particular bytes:

let hello = "Здравствуйте";

let s = &hello[0..4];

Here, ‘s’ will be a ‘&str’ that contains the first four bytes of the
string.  Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was two
bytes, which means ‘s’ will be ‘Зд’.

If we were to try to slice only part of a character's bytes with
something like ‘&hello[0..1]’, Rust would panic at runtime in the same
way as if an invalid index were accessed in a vector:

$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s
     Running `target/debug/collections`
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:19:
byte index 1 is not a char boundary; it is inside 'З' (bytes 0..2) of `Здравствуйте`
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

You should use caution when creating string slices with ranges, because
doing so can crash your program.

11.1.2.6 Methods for Iterating Over Strings
...........................................

The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about
whether you want characters or bytes.  For individual Unicode scalar
values, use the ‘chars’ method.  Calling ‘chars’ on “Зд” separates out
and returns two values of type ‘char’, and you can iterate over the
result to access each element:

for c in "Зд".chars() {
    println!("{c}");
}

This code will print the following:

З
д

Alternatively, the ‘bytes’ method returns each raw byte, which might be
appropriate for your domain:

for b in "Зд".bytes() {
    println!("{b}");
}

This code will print the four bytes that make up this string:

208
151
208
180

But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up
of more than one byte.

Getting grapheme clusters from strings, as with the Devanagari script,
is complex, so this functionality is not provided by the standard
library.  Crates are available on cratesio (https://crates.io/) if this
is the functionality you need.

11.1.2.7 Strings Are Not So Simple
..................................

To summarize, strings are complicated.  Different programming languages
make different choices about how to present this complexity to the
programmer.  Rust has chosen to make the correct handling of ‘String’
data the default behavior for all Rust programs, which means programmers
have to put more thought into handling UTF-8 data up front.  This
trade-off exposes more of the complexity of strings than is apparent in
other programming languages, but it prevents you from having to handle
errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your development life
cycle.

The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality
built off the ‘String’ and ‘&str’ types to help handle these complex
situations correctly.  Be sure to check out the documentation for useful
methods like ‘contains’ for searching in a string and ‘replace’ for
substituting parts of a string with another string.

Let's switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps,  Next: Summary 8,  Prev: Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings,  Up: Common Collections

11.1.3 Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps
-------------------------------------------------------

The last of our common collections is the ‘hash map’.  The type
‘HashMap<K, V>’ stores a mapping of keys of type ‘K’ to values of type
‘V’ using a ‘hashing function’, which determines how it places these
keys and values into memory.  Many programming languages support this
kind of data structure, but they often use a different name, such as
‘hash’, ‘map’, ‘object’, ‘hash table’, ‘dictionary’, or ‘associative
array’, just to name a few.

Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an
index, as you can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any
type.  For example, in a game, you could keep track of each team's score
in a hash map in which each key is a team's name and the values are each
team's score.  Given a team name, you can retrieve its score.

We'll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more
goodies are hiding in the functions defined on ‘HashMap<K, V>’ by the
standard library.  As always, check the standard library documentation
for more information.

11.1.3.1 Creating a New Hash Map
................................

One way to create an empty hash map is to use ‘new’ and to add elements
with ‘insert’.  In Listing 8-20, we're keeping track of the scores of
two teams whose names are ‘Blue’ and ‘Yellow’.  The Blue team starts
with 10 points, and the Yellow team starts with 50.

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

Note that we need to first ‘use’ the ‘HashMap’ from the collections
portion of the standard library.  Of our three common collections, this
one is the least often used, so it's not included in the features
brought into scope automatically in the prelude.  Hash maps also have
less support from the standard library; there's no built-in macro to
construct them, for example.

Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap.  This
‘HashMap’ has keys of type ‘String’ and values of type ‘i32’.  Like
vectors, hash maps are homogeneous: all of the keys must have the same
type, and all of the values must have the same type.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Accessing Values in a Hash Map,  Next: Hash Maps and Ownership,  Prev: Creating a New Hash Map,  Up: Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps

11.1.3.2 Accessing Values in a Hash Map
.......................................

We can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the ‘get’
method, as shown in Listing 8-21.

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

    let team_name = String::from("Blue");
    let score = scores.get(&team_name).copied().unwrap_or(0);

Here, ‘score’ will have the value that's associated with the Blue team,
and the result will be ‘10’.  The ‘get’ method returns an ‘Option<&V>’;
if there's no value for that key in the hash map, ‘get’ will return
‘None’.  This program handles the ‘Option’ by calling ‘copied’ to get an
‘Option<i32>’ rather than an ‘Option<&i32>’, then ‘unwrap_or’ to set
‘score’ to zero if ‘scores’ doesn't have an entry for the key.

We can iterate over each key-value pair in a hash map in a similar
manner as we do with vectors, using a ‘for’ loop:

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

    for (key, value) in &scores {
        println!("{key}: {value}");
    }

This code will print each pair in an arbitrary order:

Yellow: 50
Blue: 10


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Hash Maps and Ownership,  Next: Updating a Hash Map,  Prev: Accessing Values in a Hash Map,  Up: Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps

11.1.3.3 Hash Maps and Ownership
................................

For types that implement the ‘Copy’ trait, like ‘i32’, the values are
copied into the hash map.  For owned values like ‘String’, the values
will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values, as
demonstrated in Listing 8-22.

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
    let field_value = String::from("Blue");

    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(field_name, field_value);
    // field_name and field_value are invalid at this point, try using them and
    // see what compiler error you get!

We aren't able to use the variables ‘field_name’ and ‘field_value’ after
they've been moved into the hash map with the call to ‘insert’.

If we insert references to values into the hash map, the values won't be
moved into the hash map.  The values that the references point to must
be valid for at least as long as the hash map is valid.  We'll talk more
about these issues in the *note “Validating References with Lifetimes”:
Validating References with Lifetimes. section in Chapter 10.

11.1.3.4 Updating a Hash Map
............................

Although the number of key and value pairs is growable, each unique key
can only have one value associated with it at a time (but not vice
versa: for example, both the Blue team and the Yellow team could have
the value ‘10’ stored in the ‘scores’ hash map).

When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how
to handle the case when a key already has a value assigned.  You could
replace the old value with the new value, completely disregarding the
old value.  You could keep the old value and ignore the new value, only
adding the new value if the key ‘doesn't’ already have a value.  Or you
could combine the old value and the new value.  Let's look at how to do
each of these!  Overwriting a Value If we insert a key and a value into
a hash map and then insert that same key with a different value, the
value associated with that key will be replaced.  Even though the code
in Listing 8-23 calls ‘insert’ twice, the hash map will only contain one
key-value pair because we're inserting the value for the Blue team's key
both times.

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

    println!("{scores:?}");

This code will print ‘{"Blue": 25}’.  The original value of ‘10’ has
been overwritten.  Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isn't Present
It's common to check whether a particular key already exists in the hash
map with a value and then to take the following actions: if the key does
exist in the hash map, the existing value should remain the way it is;
if the key doesn't exist, insert it and a value for it.

Hash maps have a special API for this called ‘entry’ that takes the key
you want to check as a parameter.  The return value of the ‘entry’
method is an enum called ‘Entry’ that represents a value that might or
might not exist.  Let's say we want to check whether the key for the
Yellow team has a value associated with it.  If it doesn't, we want to
insert the value ‘50’, and the same for the Blue team.  Using the
‘entry’ API, the code looks like Listing 8-24.

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

    scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
    scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

    println!("{scores:?}");

The ‘or_insert’ method on ‘Entry’ is defined to return a mutable
reference to the value for the corresponding ‘Entry’ key if that key
exists, and if not, it inserts the parameter as the new value for this
key and returns a mutable reference to the new value.  This technique is
much cleaner than writing the logic ourselves and, in addition, plays
more nicely with the borrow checker.

Running the code in Listing 8-24 will print ‘{"Yellow": 50, "Blue":
10}’.  The first call to ‘entry’ will insert the key for the Yellow team
with the value ‘50’ because the Yellow team doesn't have a value
already.  The second call to ‘entry’ will not change the hash map
because the Blue team already has the value ‘10’.  Updating a Value
Based on the Old Value Another common use case for hash maps is to look
up a key's value and then update it based on the old value.  For
instance, Listing 8-25 shows code that counts how many times each word
appears in some text.  We use a hash map with the words as keys and
increment the value to keep track of how many times we've seen that
word.  If it's the first time we've seen a word, we'll first insert the
value ‘0’.

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let text = "hello world wonderful world";

    let mut map = HashMap::new();

    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }

    println!("{map:?}");

This code will print ‘{"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}’.  You
might see the same key-value pairs printed in a different order: recall
from the *note “Accessing Values in a Hash Map”: Accessing Values in a
Hash Map. section that iterating over a hash map happens in an arbitrary
order.

The ‘split_whitespace’ method returns an iterator over subslices,
separated by whitespace, of the value in ‘text’.  The ‘or_insert’ method
returns a mutable reference (‘&mut V’) to the value for the specified
key.  Here, we store that mutable reference in the ‘count’ variable, so
in order to assign to that value, we must first dereference ‘count’
using the asterisk (‘*’).  The mutable reference goes out of scope at
the end of the ‘for’ loop, so all of these changes are safe and allowed
by the borrowing rules.

11.1.3.5 Hashing Functions
..........................

By default, ‘HashMap’ uses a hashing function called ‘SipHash’ that can
provide resistance to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involving hash
tables(1).  This is not the fastest hashing algorithm available, but the
trade-off for better security that comes with the drop in performance is
worth it.  If you profile your code and find that the default hash
function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another
function by specifying a different hasher.  A ‘hasher’ is a type that
implements the ‘BuildHasher’ trait.  We'll talk about traits and how to
implement them in *note Chapter 10: Traits Defining Shared Behavior.
You don't necessarily have to implement your own hasher from scratch;
cratesio (https://crates.io/) has libraries shared by other Rust users
that provide hashers implementing many common hashing algorithms.

Vectors, strings, and hash maps will provide a large amount of
functionality necessary in programs when you need to store, access, and
modify data.  Here are some exercises you should now be equipped to
solve:

  1. Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when
     sorted, the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that
     occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.
  2. Convert strings to pig latin.  The first consonant of each word is
     moved to the end of the word and ‘ay’ is added, so ‘first’ becomes
     ‘irst-fay’.  Words that start with a vowel have ‘hay’ added to the
     end instead (‘apple’ becomes ‘apple-hay’).  Keep in mind the
     details about UTF-8 encoding!
  3. Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a
     user to add employee names to a department in a company; for
     example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then
     let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all
     people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.

The standard library API documentation describes methods that vectors,
strings, and hash maps have that will be helpful for these exercises!

We're getting into more complex programs in which operations can fail,
so it's a perfect time to discuss error handling.  We'll do that next!

12 Error Handling
*****************

Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features
for handling situations in which something goes wrong.  In many cases,
Rust requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take
some action before your code will compile.  This requirement makes your
program more robust by ensuring that you'll discover errors and handle
them appropriately before you've deployed your code to production!

Rust groups errors into two major categories: ‘recoverable’ and
‘unrecoverable’ errors.  For a recoverable error, such as a ‘file not
found’ error, we most likely just want to report the problem to the user
and retry the operation.  Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of
bugs, such as trying to access a location beyond the end of an array,
and so we want to immediately stop the program.

Most languages don't distinguish between these two kinds of errors and
handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions.  Rust
doesn't have exceptions.  Instead, it has the type ‘Result<T, E>’ for
recoverable errors and the ‘panic!’ macro that stops execution when the
program encounters an unrecoverable error.  This chapter covers calling
‘panic!’ first and then talks about returning ‘Result<T, E>’ values.
Additionally, we'll explore considerations when deciding whether to try
to recover from an error or to stop execution.

12.1 Unrecoverable Errors with ‘panic!’
=======================================

Sometimes bad things happen in your code, and there's nothing you can do
about it.  In these cases, Rust has the ‘panic!’ macro.  There are two
ways to cause a panic in practice: by taking an action that causes our
code to panic (such as accessing an array past the end) or by explicitly
calling the ‘panic!’ macro.  In both cases, we cause a panic in our
program.  By default, these panics will print a failure message, unwind,
clean up the stack, and quit.  Via an environment variable, you can also
have Rust display the call stack when a panic occurs to make it easier
to track down the source of the panic.

* Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic::

12.1.1 Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic
-------------------------------------------------------------

By default, when a panic occurs the program starts ‘unwinding’, which
means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each
function it encounters.  However, walking back and cleaning up is a lot
of work.  Rust, therefore, allows you to choose the alternative of
immediately ‘aborting’, which ends the program without cleaning up.

Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the
operating system.  If in your project you need to make the resultant
binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting
upon a panic by adding ‘panic = 'abort'’ to the appropriate ‘[profile]’
sections in your ‘Cargo.toml’ file.  For example, if you want to abort
on panic in release mode, add this:

[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'

Let's try calling ‘panic!’ in a simple program:

fn main() {
    panic!("crash and burn");
}

When you run the program, you'll see something like this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25s
     Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:2:5:
crash and burn
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

The call to ‘panic!’ causes the error message contained in the last two
lines.  The first line shows our panic message and the place in our
source code where the panic occurred: ‘src/main.rs:2:5’ indicates that
it's the second line, fifth character of our ‘src/main.rs’ file.

In this case, the line indicated is part of our code, and if we go to
that line, we see the ‘panic!’ macro call.  In other cases, the ‘panic!’
call might be in code that our code calls, and the filename and line
number reported by the error message will be someone else's code where
the ‘panic!’ macro is called, not the line of our code that eventually
led to the ‘panic!’ call.

We can use the backtrace of the functions the ‘panic!’ call came from to
figure out the part of our code that is causing the problem.  To
understand how to use a ‘panic!’ backtrace, let's look at another
example and see what it's like when a ‘panic!’ call comes from a library
because of a bug in our code instead of from our code calling the macro
directly.  Listing 9-1 has some code that attempts to access an index in
a vector beyond the range of valid indexes.

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v[99];
}

Here, we're attempting to access the 100th element of our vector (which
is at index 99 because indexing starts at zero), but the vector has only
three elements.  In this situation, Rust will panic.  Using ‘[]’ is
supposed to return an element, but if you pass an invalid index, there's
no element that Rust could return here that would be correct.

In C, attempting to read beyond the end of a data structure is undefined
behavior.  You might get whatever is at the location in memory that
would correspond to that element in the data structure, even though the
memory doesn't belong to that structure.  This is called a ‘buffer
overread’ and can lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is
able to manipulate the index in such a way as to read data they
shouldn't be allowed to that is stored after the data structure.

To protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to
read an element at an index that doesn't exist, Rust will stop execution
and refuse to continue.  Let's try it and see:

$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s
     Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:
index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

This error points at line 4 of our ‘main.rs’ where we attempt to access
index ‘99’ of the vector in ‘v’.

The ‘note:’ line tells us that we can set the ‘RUST_BACKTRACE’
environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to
cause the error.  A ‘backtrace’ is a list of all the functions that have
been called to get to this point.  Backtraces in Rust work as they do in
other languages: the key to reading the backtrace is to start from the
top and read until you see files you wrote.  That's the spot where the
problem originated.  The lines above that spot are code that your code
has called; the lines below are code that called your code.  These
before-and-after lines might include core Rust code, standard library
code, or crates that you're using.  Let's try getting a backtrace by
setting the ‘RUST_BACKTRACE’ environment variable to any value except
‘0’.  Listing 9-2 shows output similar to what you'll see.

$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:

note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.

That's a lot of output!  The exact output you see might be different
depending on your operating system and Rust version.  In order to get
backtraces with this information, debug symbols must be enabled.  Debug
symbols are enabled by default when using ‘cargo build’ or ‘cargo run’
without the ‘--release’ flag, as we have here.

In the output in Listing 9-2, line 6 of the backtrace points to the line
in our project that's causing the problem: line 4 of ‘src/main.rs’.  If
we don't want our program to panic, we should start our investigation at
the location pointed to by the first line mentioning a file we wrote.
In Listing 9-1, where we deliberately wrote code that would panic, the
way to fix the panic is to not request an element beyond the range of
the vector indexes.  When your code panics in the future, you'll need to
figure out what action the code is taking with what values to cause the
panic and what the code should do instead.

We'll come back to ‘panic!’ and when we should and should not use
‘panic!’ to handle error conditions in the *note “To ‘panic!’ or Not to
‘panic!’”: To panic! or Not to panic!. section later in this chapter.
Next, we'll look at how to recover from an error using ‘Result’.

12.1.2 Recoverable Errors with ‘Result’
---------------------------------------

Most errors aren't serious enough to require the program to stop
entirely.  Sometimes when a function fails it's for a reason that you
can easily interpret and respond to.  For example, if you try to open a
file and that operation fails because the file doesn't exist, you might
want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

Recall from *note “Handling Potential Failure with ‘Result’”: Handling
Potential Failure with Result. in Chapter 2 that the ‘Result’ enum is
defined as having two variants, ‘Ok’ and ‘Err’, as follows:

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}

The ‘T’ and ‘E’ are generic type parameters: we'll discuss generics in
more detail in Chapter 10.  What you need to know right now is that ‘T’
represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case
within the ‘Ok’ variant, and ‘E’ represents the type of the error that
will be returned in a failure case within the ‘Err’ variant.  Because
‘Result’ has these generic type parameters, we can use the ‘Result’ type
and the functions defined on it in many different situations where the
success value and error value we want to return may differ.

Let's call a function that returns a ‘Result’ value because the function
could fail.  In Listing 9-3 we try to open a file.

use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
}

The return type of ‘File::open’ is a ‘Result<T, E>’.  The generic
parameter ‘T’ has been filled in by the implementation of ‘File::open’
with the type of the success value, ‘std::fs::File’, which is a file
handle.  The type of ‘E’ used in the error value is ‘std::io::Error’.
This return type means the call to ‘File::open’ might succeed and return
a file handle that we can read from or write to.  The function call also
might fail: for example, the file might not exist, or we might not have
permission to access the file.  The ‘File::open’ function needs to have
a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at the same time
give us either the file handle or error information.  This information
is exactly what the ‘Result’ enum conveys.

In the case where ‘File::open’ succeeds, the value in the variable
‘greeting_file_result’ will be an instance of ‘Ok’ that contains a file
handle.  In the case where it fails, the value in ‘greeting_file_result’
will be an instance of ‘Err’ that contains more information about the
kind of error that occurred.

We need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions
depending on the value ‘File::open’ returns.  Listing 9-4 shows one way
to handle the ‘Result’ using a basic tool, the ‘match’ expression that
we discussed in Chapter 6.

use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}"),
    };
}

Note that, like the ‘Option’ enum, the ‘Result’ enum and its variants
have been brought into scope by the prelude, so we don't need to specify
‘Result::’ before the ‘Ok’ and ‘Err’ variants in the ‘match’ arms.

When the result is ‘Ok’, this code will return the inner ‘file’ value
out of the ‘Ok’ variant, and we then assign that file handle value to
the variable ‘greeting_file’.  After the ‘match’, we can use the file
handle for reading or writing.

The other arm of the ‘match’ handles the case where we get an ‘Err’
value from ‘File::open’.  In this example, we've chosen to call the
‘panic!’ macro.  If there's no file named ‘hello.txt’ in our current
directory and we run this code, we'll see the following output from the
‘panic!’ macro:

$ cargo run
   Compiling error-handling v0.1.0 (file:///projects/error-handling)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.73s
     Running `target/debug/error-handling`
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:8:23:
Problem opening the file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

As usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.

12.1.2.1 Matching on Different Errors
.....................................

The code in Listing 9-4 will ‘panic!’ no matter why ‘File::open’ failed.
However, we want to take different actions for different failure
reasons.  If ‘File::open’ failed because the file doesn't exist, we want
to create the file and return the handle to the new file.  If
‘File::open’ failed for any other reason--for example, because we didn't
have permission to open the file--we still want the code to ‘panic!’ in
the same way it did in Listing 9-4.  For this, we add an inner ‘match’
expression, shown in Listing 9-5.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {e:?}"),
            },
            other_error => {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {other_error:?}");
            }
        },
    };
}

The type of the value that ‘File::open’ returns inside the ‘Err’ variant
is ‘io::Error’, which is a struct provided by the standard library.
This struct has a method ‘kind’ that we can call to get an
‘io::ErrorKind’ value.  The enum ‘io::ErrorKind’ is provided by the
standard library and has variants representing the different kinds of
errors that might result from an ‘io’ operation.  The variant we want to
use is ‘ErrorKind::NotFound’, which indicates the file we're trying to
open doesn't exist yet.  So we match on ‘greeting_file_result’, but we
also have an inner match on ‘error.kind()’.

The condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value
returned by ‘error.kind()’ is the ‘NotFound’ variant of the ‘ErrorKind’
enum.  If it is, we try to create the file with ‘File::create’.
However, because ‘File::create’ could also fail, we need a second arm in
the inner ‘match’ expression.  When the file can't be created, a
different error message is printed.  The second arm of the outer ‘match’
stays the same, so the program panics on any error besides the missing
file error.

Alternatives to Using ‘match’ with ‘Result<T, E>’ That's a lot of
‘match’!  The ‘match’ expression is very useful but also very much a
primitive.  In Chapter 13, you'll learn about closures, which are used
with many of the methods defined on ‘Result<T, E>’.  These methods can
be more concise than using ‘match’ when handling ‘Result<T, E>’ values
in your code.

For example, here's another way to write the same logic as shown in
Listing 9-5, this time using closures and the ‘unwrap_or_else’ method:

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!("Problem creating the file: {error:?}");
            })
        } else {
            panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}");
        }
    });
}

Although this code has the same behavior as Listing 9-5, it doesn't
contain any ‘match’ expressions and is cleaner to read.  Come back to
this example after you've read Chapter 13, and look up the
‘unwrap_or_else’ method in the standard library documentation.  Many
more of these methods can clean up huge nested ‘match’ expressions when
you're dealing with errors.

Shortcuts for Panic on Error: ‘unwrap’ and ‘expect’ Using ‘match’ works
well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn't always communicate
intent well.  The ‘Result<T, E>’ type has many helper methods defined on
it to do various, more specific tasks.  The ‘unwrap’ method is a
shortcut method implemented just like the ‘match’ expression we wrote in
Listing 9-4.  If the ‘Result’ value is the ‘Ok’ variant, ‘unwrap’ will
return the value inside the ‘Ok’.  If the ‘Result’ is the ‘Err’ variant,
‘unwrap’ will call the ‘panic!’ macro for us.  Here is an example of
‘unwrap’ in action:

use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
}

If we run this code without a ‘hello.txt’ file, we'll see an error
message from the ‘panic!’ call that the ‘unwrap’ method makes:

thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:49:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }

Similarly, the ‘expect’ method lets us also choose the ‘panic!’ error
message.  Using ‘expect’ instead of ‘unwrap’ and providing good error
messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a
panic easier.  The syntax of ‘expect’ looks like this:

use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")
        .expect("hello.txt should be included in this project");
}

We use ‘expect’ in the same way as ‘unwrap’: to return the file handle
or call the ‘panic!’ macro.  The error message used by ‘expect’ in its
call to ‘panic!’ will be the parameter that we pass to ‘expect’, rather
than the default ‘panic!’ message that ‘unwrap’ uses.  Here's what it
looks like:

thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:5:10:
hello.txt should be included in this project: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }

In production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose ‘expect’ rather than
‘unwrap’ and give more context about why the operation is expected to
always succeed.  That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong,
you have more information to use in debugging.

12.1.2.2 Propagating Errors
...........................

When a function's implementation calls something that might fail,
instead of handling the error within the function itself you can return
the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do.  This is
known as ‘propagating’ the error and gives more control to the calling
code, where there might be more information or logic that dictates how
the error should be handled than what you have available in the context
of your code.

For example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a
file.  If the file doesn't exist or can't be read, this function will
return those errors to the code that called the function.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let username_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let mut username_file = match username_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    let mut username = String::new();

    match username_file.read_to_string(&mut username) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(username),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}

This function can be written in a much shorter way, but we're going to
start by doing a lot of it manually in order to explore error handling;
at the end, we'll show the shorter way.  Let's look at the return type
of the function first: ‘Result<String, io::Error>’.  This means the
function is returning a value of the type ‘Result<T, E>’, where the
generic parameter ‘T’ has been filled in with the concrete type ‘String’
and the generic type ‘E’ has been filled in with the concrete type
‘io::Error’.

If this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this
function will receive an ‘Ok’ value that holds a ‘String’--the
‘username’ that this function read from the file.  If this function
encounters any problems, the calling code will receive an ‘Err’ value
that holds an instance of ‘io::Error’ that contains more information
about what the problems were.  We chose ‘io::Error’ as the return type
of this function because that happens to be the type of the error value
returned from both of the operations we're calling in this function's
body that might fail: the ‘File::open’ function and the ‘read_to_string’
method.

The body of the function starts by calling the ‘File::open’ function.
Then we handle the ‘Result’ value with a ‘match’ similar to the ‘match’
in Listing 9-4.  If ‘File::open’ succeeds, the file handle in the
pattern variable ‘file’ becomes the value in the mutable variable
‘username_file’ and the function continues.  In the ‘Err’ case, instead
of calling ‘panic!’, we use the ‘return’ keyword to return early out of
the function entirely and pass the error value from ‘File::open’, now in
the pattern variable ‘e’, back to the calling code as this function's
error value.

So, if we have a file handle in ‘username_file’, the function then
creates a new ‘String’ in variable ‘username’ and calls the
‘read_to_string’ method on the file handle in ‘username_file’ to read
the contents of the file into ‘username’.  The ‘read_to_string’ method
also returns a ‘Result’ because it might fail, even though ‘File::open’
succeeded.  So we need another ‘match’ to handle that ‘Result’: if
‘read_to_string’ succeeds, then our function has succeeded, and we
return the username from the file that's now in ‘username’ wrapped in an
‘Ok’.  If ‘read_to_string’ fails, we return the error value in the same
way that we returned the error value in the ‘match’ that handled the
return value of ‘File::open’.  However, we don't need to explicitly say
‘return’, because this is the last expression in the function.

The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an ‘Ok’
value that contains a username or an ‘Err’ value that contains an
‘io::Error’.  It's up to the calling code to decide what to do with
those values.  If the calling code gets an ‘Err’ value, it could call
‘panic!’ and crash the program, use a default username, or look up the
username from somewhere other than a file, for example.  We don't have
enough information on what the calling code is actually trying to do, so
we propagate all the success or error information upward for it to
handle appropriately.

This pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust
provides the question mark operator ‘?’ to make this easier.  A Shortcut
for Propagating Errors: the ‘?’ Operator Listing 9-7 shows an
implementation of ‘read_username_from_file’ that has the same
functionality as in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the ‘?’
operator.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    let mut username = String::new();
    username_file.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    Ok(username)
}

The ‘?’ placed after a ‘Result’ value is defined to work in almost the
same way as the ‘match’ expressions we defined to handle the ‘Result’
values in Listing 9-6.  If the value of the ‘Result’ is an ‘Ok’, the
value inside the ‘Ok’ will get returned from this expression, and the
program will continue.  If the value is an ‘Err’, the ‘Err’ will be
returned from the whole function as if we had used the ‘return’ keyword
so the error value gets propagated to the calling code.

There is a difference between what the ‘match’ expression from Listing
9-6 does and what the ‘?’ operator does: error values that have the ‘?’
operator called on them go through the ‘from’ function, defined in the
‘From’ trait in the standard library, which is used to convert values
from one type into another.  When the ‘?’ operator calls the ‘from’
function, the error type received is converted into the error type
defined in the return type of the current function.  This is useful when
a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function
might fail, even if parts might fail for many different reasons.

For example, we could change the ‘read_username_from_file’ function in
Listing 9-7 to return a custom error type named ‘OurError’ that we
define.  If we also define ‘impl From<io::Error> for OurError’ to
construct an instance of ‘OurError’ from an ‘io::Error’, then the ‘?’
operator calls in the body of ‘read_username_from_file’ will call ‘from’
and convert the error types without needing to add any more code to the
function.

In the context of Listing 9-7, the ‘?’ at the end of the ‘File::open’
call will return the value inside an ‘Ok’ to the variable
‘username_file’.  If an error occurs, the ‘?’ operator will return early
out of the whole function and give any ‘Err’ value to the calling code.
The same thing applies to the ‘?’ at the end of the ‘read_to_string’
call.

The ‘?’ operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this
function's implementation simpler.  We could even shorten this code
further by chaining method calls immediately after the ‘?’, as shown in
Listing 9-8.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username = String::new();

    File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut username)?;

    Ok(username)
}

We've moved the creation of the new ‘String’ in ‘username’ to the
beginning of the function; that part hasn't changed.  Instead of
creating a variable ‘username_file’, we've chained the call to
‘read_to_string’ directly onto the result of ‘File::open("hello.txt")?’.
We still have a ‘?’ at the end of the ‘read_to_string’ call, and we
still return an ‘Ok’ value containing ‘username’ when both ‘File::open’
and ‘read_to_string’ succeed rather than returning errors.  The
functionality is again the same as in Listing 9-6 and Listing 9-7; this
is just a different, more ergonomic way to write it.

Listing 9-9 shows a way to make this even shorter using
‘fs::read_to_string’.

use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    fs::read_to_string("hello.txt")
}

Reading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the
standard library provides the convenient ‘fs::read_to_string’ function
that opens the file, creates a new ‘String’, reads the contents of the
file, puts the contents into that ‘String’, and returns it.  Of course,
using ‘fs::read_to_string’ doesn't give us the opportunity to explain
all the error handling, so we did it the longer way first.  Where The
‘?’ Operator Can Be Used The ‘?’ operator can only be used in functions
whose return type is compatible with the value the ‘?’ is used on.  This
is because the ‘?’ operator is defined to perform an early return of a
value out of the function, in the same manner as the ‘match’ expression
we defined in Listing 9-6.  In Listing 9-6, the ‘match’ was using a
‘Result’ value, and the early return arm returned an ‘Err(e)’ value.
The return type of the function has to be a ‘Result’ so that it's
compatible with this ‘return’.

In Listing 9-10, let's look at the error we'll get if we use the ‘?’
operator in a ‘main’ function with a return type that is incompatible
with the type of the value we use ‘?’ on.

use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
}

This code opens a file, which might fail.  The ‘?’ operator follows the
‘Result’ value returned by ‘File::open’, but this ‘main’ function has
the return type of ‘()’, not ‘Result’.  When we compile this code, we
get the following error message:

$ cargo run

This error points out that we're only allowed to use the ‘?’ operator in
a function that returns ‘Result’, ‘Option’, or another type that
implements ‘FromResidual’.

To fix the error, you have two choices.  One choice is to change the
return type of your function to be compatible with the value you're
using the ‘?’ operator on as long as you have no restrictions preventing
that.  The other choice is to use a ‘match’ or one of the ‘Result<T, E>’
methods to handle the ‘Result<T, E>’ in whatever way is appropriate.

The error message also mentioned that ‘?’ can be used with ‘Option<T>’
values as well.  As with using ‘?’ on ‘Result’, you can only use ‘?’ on
‘Option’ in a function that returns an ‘Option’.  The behavior of the
‘?’ operator when called on an ‘Option<T>’ is similar to its behavior
when called on a ‘Result<T, E>’: if the value is ‘None’, the ‘None’ will
be returned early from the function at that point.  If the value is
‘Some’, the value inside the ‘Some’ is the resultant value of the
expression, and the function continues.  Listing 9-11 has an example of
a function that finds the last character of the first line in the given
text.

fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &str) -> Option<char> {
    text.lines().next()?.chars().last()
}

This function returns ‘Option<char>’ because it's possible that there is
a character there, but it's also possible that there isn't.  This code
takes the ‘text’ string slice argument and calls the ‘lines’ method on
it, which returns an iterator over the lines in the string.  Because
this function wants to examine the first line, it calls ‘next’ on the
iterator to get the first value from the iterator.  If ‘text’ is the
empty string, this call to ‘next’ will return ‘None’, in which case we
use ‘?’ to stop and return ‘None’ from ‘last_char_of_first_line’.  If
‘text’ is not the empty string, ‘next’ will return a ‘Some’ value
containing a string slice of the first line in ‘text’.

The ‘?’ extracts the string slice, and we can call ‘chars’ on that
string slice to get an iterator of its characters.  We're interested in
the last character in this first line, so we call ‘last’ to return the
last item in the iterator.  This is an ‘Option’ because it's possible
that the first line is the empty string; for example, if ‘text’ starts
with a blank line but has characters on other lines, as in ‘"\nhi"’.
However, if there is a last character on the first line, it will be
returned in the ‘Some’ variant.  The ‘?’ operator in the middle gives us
a concise way to express this logic, allowing us to implement the
function in one line.  If we couldn't use the ‘?’ operator on ‘Option’,
we'd have to implement this logic using more method calls or a ‘match’
expression.

Note that you can use the ‘?’ operator on a ‘Result’ in a function that
returns ‘Result’, and you can use the ‘?’ operator on an ‘Option’ in a
function that returns ‘Option’, but you can't mix and match.  The ‘?’
operator won't automatically convert a ‘Result’ to an ‘Option’ or vice
versa; in those cases, you can use methods like the ‘ok’ method on
‘Result’ or the ‘ok_or’ method on ‘Option’ to do the conversion
explicitly.

So far, all the ‘main’ functions we've used return ‘()’.  The ‘main’
function is special because it's the entry point and exit point of an
executable program, and there are restrictions on what its return type
can be for the program to behave as expected.

Luckily, ‘main’ can also return a ‘Result<(), E>’.  Listing 9-12 has the
code from Listing 9-10, but we've changed the return type of ‘main’ to
be ‘Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>’ and added a return value ‘Ok(())’ to the
end.  This code will now compile.

use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;

    Ok(())
}

The ‘Box<dyn Error>’ type is a ‘trait object’, which we'll talk about in
the *note “Using Trait Objects that Allow for Values of Different
Types”: Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types.
section in Chapter 18.  For now, you can read ‘Box<dyn Error>’ to mean
“any kind of error.” Using ‘?’ on a ‘Result’ value in a ‘main’ function
with the error type ‘Box<dyn Error>’ is allowed because it allows any
‘Err’ value to be returned early.  Even though the body of this ‘main’
function will only ever return errors of type ‘std::io::Error’, by
specifying ‘Box<dyn Error>’, this signature will continue to be correct
even if more code that returns other errors is added to the body of
‘main’.

When a ‘main’ function returns a ‘Result<(), E>’, the executable will
exit with a value of ‘0’ if ‘main’ returns ‘Ok(())’ and will exit with a
nonzero value if ‘main’ returns an ‘Err’ value.  Executables written in
C return integers when they exit: programs that exit successfully return
the integer ‘0’, and programs that error return some integer other than
‘0’.  Rust also returns integers from executables to be compatible with
this convention.

The ‘main’ function may return any types that implement the
‘stdprocessTermination’ trait
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/process/trait.Termination.html),
which contains a function ‘report’ that returns an ‘ExitCode’.  Consult
the standard library documentation for more information on implementing
the ‘Termination’ trait for your own types.

Now that we've discussed the details of calling ‘panic!’ or returning
‘Result’, let's return to the topic of how to decide which is
appropriate to use in which cases.

12.1.3 To ‘panic!’ or Not to ‘panic!’
-------------------------------------

So how do you decide when you should call ‘panic!’ and when you should
return ‘Result’?  When code panics, there's no way to recover.  You
could call ‘panic!’ for any error situation, whether there's a possible
way to recover or not, but then you're making the decision that a
situation is unrecoverable on behalf of the calling code.  When you
choose to return a ‘Result’ value, you give the calling code options.
The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a way that's
appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an ‘Err’ value in
this case is unrecoverable, so it can call ‘panic!’ and turn your
recoverable error into an unrecoverable one.  Therefore, returning
‘Result’ is a good default choice when you're defining a function that
might fail.

In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it's more
appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a ‘Result’.
Let's explore why, then discuss situations in which the compiler can't
tell that failure is impossible, but you as a human can.  The chapter
will conclude with some general guidelines on how to decide whether to
panic in library code.

12.1.3.1 Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests
............................................

When you're writing an example to illustrate some concept, also
including robust error-handling code can make the example less clear.
In examples, it's understood that a call to a method like ‘unwrap’ that
could panic is meant as a placeholder for the way you'd want your
application to handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of
your code is doing.

Similarly, the ‘unwrap’ and ‘expect’ methods are very handy when
prototyping, before you're ready to decide how to handle errors.  They
leave clear markers in your code for when you're ready to make your
program more robust.

If a method call fails in a test, you'd want the whole test to fail,
even if that method isn't the functionality under test.  Because
‘panic!’ is how a test is marked as a failure, calling ‘unwrap’ or
‘expect’ is exactly what should happen.

12.1.3.2 Cases in Which You Have More Information Than the
..........................................................

Compiler It would also be appropriate to call ‘unwrap’ or ‘expect’ when
you have some other logic that ensures the ‘Result’ will have an ‘Ok’
value, but the logic isn't something the compiler understands.  You'll
still have a ‘Result’ value that you need to handle: whatever operation
you're calling still has the possibility of failing in general, even
though it's logically impossible in your particular situation.  If you
can ensure by manually inspecting the code that you'll never have an
‘Err’ variant, it's perfectly acceptable to call ‘unwrap’, and even
better to document the reason you think you'll never have an ‘Err’
variant in the ‘expect’ text.  Here's an example:

    use std::net::IpAddr;

    let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1"
        .parse()
        .expect("Hardcoded IP address should be valid");

We're creating an ‘IpAddr’ instance by parsing a hardcoded string.  We
can see that ‘127.0.0.1’ is a valid IP address, so it's acceptable to
use ‘expect’ here.  However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn't
change the return type of the ‘parse’ method: we still get a ‘Result’
value, and the compiler will still make us handle the ‘Result’ as if the
‘Err’ variant is a possibility because the compiler isn't smart enough
to see that this string is always a valid IP address.  If the IP address
string came from a user rather than being hardcoded into the program and
therefore ‘did’ have a possibility of failure, we'd definitely want to
handle the ‘Result’ in a more robust way instead.  Mentioning the
assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to change
‘expect’ to better error-handling code if, in the future, we need to get
the IP address from some other source instead.

12.1.3.3 Guidelines for Error Handling
......................................

It's advisable to have your code panic when it's possible that your code
could end up in a bad state.  In this context, a ‘bad state’ is when
some assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such
as when invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are
passed to your code--plus one or more of the following:

   • The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to
     something that will likely happen occasionally, like a user
     entering data in the wrong format.
   • Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad
     state, rather than checking for the problem at every step.
   • There's not a good way to encode this information in the types you
     use.  We'll work through an example of what we mean in the *note
     “Encoding States and Behavior as Types”:
     #book__pandoc__texi__src__ch18-03-oo-design-patternsmd__encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types.
     section of Chapter 18.

If someone calls your code and passes in values that don't make sense,
it's best to return an error if you can so the user of the library can
decide what they want to do in that case.  However, in cases where
continuing could be insecure or harmful, the best choice might be to
call ‘panic!’ and alert the person using your library to the bug in
their code so they can fix it during development.  Similarly, ‘panic!’
is often appropriate if you're calling external code that is out of your
control and it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.

However, when failure is expected, it's more appropriate to return a
‘Result’ than to make a ‘panic!’ call.  Examples include a parser being
given malformed data or an HTTP request returning a status that
indicates you have hit a rate limit.  In these cases, returning a
‘Result’ indicates that failure is an expected possibility that the
calling code must decide how to handle.

When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if
it's called using invalid values, your code should verify the values are
valid first and panic if the values aren't valid.  This is mostly for
safety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your
code to vulnerabilities.  This is the main reason the standard library
will call ‘panic!’ if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying
to access memory that doesn't belong to the current data structure is a
common security problem.  Functions often have ‘contracts’: their
behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular requirements.
Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a contract
violation always indicates a caller-side bug, and it's not a kind of
error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle.  In fact,
there's no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling
‘programmers’ need to fix the code.  Contracts for a function,
especially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in
the API documentation for the function.

However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be
verbose and annoying.  Fortunately, you can use Rust's type system (and
thus the type checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks
for you.  If your function has a particular type as a parameter, you can
proceed with your code's logic knowing that the compiler has already
ensured you have a valid value.  For example, if you have a type rather
than an ‘Option’, your program expects to have ‘something’ rather than
‘nothing’.  Your code then doesn't have to handle two cases for the
‘Some’ and ‘None’ variants: it will only have one case for definitely
having a value.  Code trying to pass nothing to your function won't even
compile, so your function doesn't have to check for that case at
runtime.  Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as
‘u32’, which ensures the parameter is never negative.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Creating Custom Types for Validation,  Next: Summary 9,  Prev: Guidelines for Error Handling,  Up: To panic! or Not to panic!

12.1.3.4 Creating Custom Types for Validation
.............................................

Let's take the idea of using Rust's type system to ensure we have a
valid value one step further and look at creating a custom type for
validation.  Recall the guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code
asked the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.  We never validated
that the user's guess was between those numbers before checking it
against our secret number; we only validated that the guess was
positive.  In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our output
of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be correct.  But it would be a
useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have
different behavior when the user guesses a number that's out of range
versus when the user types, for example, letters instead.

One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an ‘i32’ instead of
only a ‘u32’ to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check
for the number being in range, like so:

    loop {
        // --snip--

        let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        if guess < 1 || guess > 100 {
            println!("The secret number will be between 1 and 100.");
            continue;
        }

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            // --snip--
    }

The ‘if’ expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the
user about the problem, and calls ‘continue’ to start the next iteration
of the loop and ask for another guess.  After the ‘if’ expression, we
can proceed with the comparisons between ‘guess’ and the secret number
knowing that ‘guess’ is between 1 and 100.

However, this is not an ideal solution: if it were absolutely critical
that the program only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had
many functions with this requirement, having a check like this in every
function would be tedious (and might impact performance).

Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to
create an instance of the type rather than repeating the validations
everywhere.  That way, it's safe for functions to use the new type in
their signatures and confidently use the values they receive.  Listing
9-13 shows one way to define a ‘Guess’ type that will only create an
instance of ‘Guess’ if the ‘new’ function receives a value between 1 and
100.

pub struct Guess {
    value: i32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 || value > 100 {
            panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {value}.");
        }

        Guess { value }
    }

    pub fn value(&self) -> i32 {
        self.value
    }
}

First we define a struct named ‘Guess’ that has a field named ‘value’
that holds an ‘i32’.  This is where the number will be stored.

Then we implement an associated function named ‘new’ on ‘Guess’ that
creates instances of ‘Guess’ values.  The ‘new’ function is defined to
have one parameter named ‘value’ of type ‘i32’ and to return a ‘Guess’.
The code in the body of the ‘new’ function tests ‘value’ to make sure
it's between 1 and 100.  If ‘value’ doesn't pass this test, we make a
‘panic!’ call, which will alert the programmer who is writing the
calling code that they have a bug they need to fix, because creating a
‘Guess’ with a ‘value’ outside this range would violate the contract
that ‘Guess::new’ is relying on.  The conditions in which ‘Guess::new’
might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API documentation;
we'll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility of a
‘panic!’ in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14.  If
‘value’ does pass the test, we create a new ‘Guess’ with its ‘value’
field set to the ‘value’ parameter and return the ‘Guess’.

Next, we implement a method named ‘value’ that borrows ‘self’, doesn't
have any other parameters, and returns an ‘i32’.  This kind of method is
sometimes called a ‘getter’ because its purpose is to get some data from
its fields and return it.  This public method is necessary because the
‘value’ field of the ‘Guess’ struct is private.  It's important that the
‘value’ field be private so code using the ‘Guess’ struct is not allowed
to set ‘value’ directly: code outside the module ‘must’ use the
‘Guess::new’ function to create an instance of ‘Guess’, thereby ensuring
there's no way for a ‘Guess’ to have a ‘value’ that hasn't been checked
by the conditions in the ‘Guess::new’ function.

A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and
100 could then declare in its signature that it takes or returns a
‘Guess’ rather than an ‘i32’ and wouldn't need to do any additional
checks in its body.

12.1.4 Summary
--------------

Rust's error-handling features are designed to help you write more
robust code.  The ‘panic!’ macro signals that your program is in a state
it can't handle and lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying
to proceed with invalid or incorrect values.  The ‘Result’ enum uses
Rust's type system to indicate that operations might fail in a way that
your code could recover from.  You can use ‘Result’ to tell code that
calls your code that it needs to handle potential success or failure as
well.  Using ‘panic!’ and ‘Result’ in the appropriate situations will
make your code more reliable in the face of inevitable problems.

Now that you've seen useful ways that the standard library uses generics
with the ‘Option’ and ‘Result’ enums, we'll talk about how generics work
and how you can use them in your code.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Generic Types Traits and Lifetimes,  Next: Writing Automated Tests,  Prev: Error Handling,  Up: Top

13 Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes
***************************************

Every programming language has tools for effectively handling the
duplication of concepts.  In Rust, one such tool is ‘generics’: abstract
stand-ins for concrete types or other properties.  We can express the
behavior of generics or how they relate to other generics without
knowing what will be in their place when compiling and running the code.

Functions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a
concrete type like ‘i32’ or ‘String’, in the same way they take
parameters with unknown values to run the same code on multiple concrete
values.  In fact, we've already used generics in Chapter 6 with
‘Option<T>’, in Chapter 8 with ‘Vec<T>’ and ‘HashMap<K, V>’, and in
Chapter 9 with ‘Result<T, E>’.  In this chapter, you'll explore how to
define your own types, functions, and methods with generics!

First we'll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication.
We'll then use the same technique to make a generic function from two
functions that differ only in the types of their parameters.  We'll also
explain how to use generic types in struct and enum definitions.

Then you'll learn how to use ‘traits’ to define behavior in a generic
way.  You can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic
type to accept only those types that have a particular behavior, as
opposed to just any type.

Finally, we'll discuss ‘lifetimes’: a variety of generics that give the
compiler information about how references relate to each other.
Lifetimes allow us to give the compiler enough information about
borrowed values so that it can ensure references will be valid in more
situations than it could without our help.

13.1 Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function
==================================================

Generics allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder that
represents multiple types to remove code duplication.  Before diving
into generics syntax, let's first look at how to remove duplication in a
way that doesn't involve generic types by extracting a function that
replaces specific values with a placeholder that represents multiple
values.  Then we'll apply the same technique to extract a generic
function!  By looking at how to recognize duplicated code you can
extract into a function, you'll start to recognize duplicated code that
can use generics.

We'll begin with the short program in Listing 10-1 that finds the
largest number in a list.

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &number_list[0];

    for number in &number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {largest}");
}

We store a list of integers in the variable ‘number_list’ and place a
reference to the first number in the list in a variable named ‘largest’.
We then iterate through all the numbers in the list, and if the current
number is greater than the number stored in ‘largest’, we replace the
reference in that variable.  However, if the current number is less than
or equal to the largest number seen so far, the variable doesn't change,
and the code moves on to the next number in the list.  After considering
all the numbers in the list, ‘largest’ should refer to the largest
number, which in this case is 100.

We've now been tasked with finding the largest number in two different
lists of numbers.  To do so, we can choose to duplicate the code in
Listing 10-1 and use the same logic at two different places in the
program, as shown in Listing 10-2.

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &number_list[0];

    for number in &number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {largest}");

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let mut largest = &number_list[0];

    for number in &number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {largest}");
}

Although this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error prone.
We also have to remember to update the code in multiple places when we
want to change it.

To eliminate this duplication, we'll create an abstraction by defining a
function that operates on any list of integers passed in as a parameter.
This solution makes our code clearer and lets us express the concept of
finding the largest number in a list abstractly.

In Listing 10-3, we extract the code that finds the largest number into
a function named ‘largest’.  Then we call the function to find the
largest number in the two lists from Listing 10-2.  We could also use
the function on any other list of ‘i32’ values we might have in the
future.

fn largest(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {result}");

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {result}");
}

The ‘largest’ function has a parameter called ‘list’, which represents
any concrete slice of ‘i32’ values we might pass into the function.  As
a result, when we call the function, the code runs on the specific
values that we pass in.

In summary, here are the steps we took to change the code from Listing
10-2 to Listing 10-3:

  1. Identify duplicate code.
  2. Extract the duplicate code into the body of the function, and
     specify the inputs and return values of that code in the function
     signature.
  3. Update the two instances of duplicated code to call the function
     instead.

Next, we'll use these same steps with generics to reduce code
duplication.  In the same way that the function body can operate on an
abstract ‘list’ instead of specific values, generics allow code to
operate on abstract types.

For example, say we had two functions: one that finds the largest item
in a slice of ‘i32’ values and one that finds the largest item in a
slice of ‘char’ values.  How would we eliminate that duplication?  Let's
find out!

13.1.1 Generic Data Types
-------------------------

We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures
or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data
types.  Let's first look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and
methods using generics.  Then we'll discuss how generics affect code
performance.

13.1.1.1 In Function Definitions
................................

When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in
the signature of the function where we would usually specify the data
types of the parameters and return value.  Doing so makes our code more
flexible and provides more functionality to callers of our function
while preventing code duplication.

Continuing with our ‘largest’ function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions
that both find the largest value in a slice.  We'll then combine these
into a single function that uses generics.

fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {result}");

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {result}");
}

The ‘largest_i32’ function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that
finds the largest ‘i32’ in a slice.  The ‘largest_char’ function finds
the largest ‘char’ in a slice.  The function bodies have the same code,
so let's eliminate the duplication by introducing a generic type
parameter in a single function.

To parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the
type parameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function.
You can use any identifier as a type parameter name.  But we'll use ‘T’
because, by convention, type parameter names in Rust are short, often
just one letter, and Rust's type-naming convention is UpperCamelCase.
Short for ‘type’, ‘T’ is the default choice of most Rust programmers.

When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare
the parameter name in the signature so the compiler knows what that name
means.  Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function
signature, we have to declare the type parameter name before we use it.
To define the generic ‘largest’ function, we place type name
declarations inside angle brackets, ‘<>’, between the name of the
function and the parameter list, like this:

fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {

We read this definition as: the function ‘largest’ is generic over some
type ‘T’.  This function has one parameter named ‘list’, which is a
slice of values of type ‘T’.  The ‘largest’ function will return a
reference to a value of the same type ‘T’.

Listing 10-5 shows the combined ‘largest’ function definition using the
generic data type in its signature.  The listing also shows how we can
call the function with either a slice of ‘i32’ values or ‘char’ values.
Note that this code won't compile yet, but we'll fix it later in this
chapter.

fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {result}");

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {result}");
}

If we compile this code right now, we'll get this error:

The help text mentions ‘std::cmp::PartialOrd’, which is a ‘trait’, and
we're going to talk about traits in the next section.  For now, know
that this error states that the body of ‘largest’ won't work for all
possible types that ‘T’ could be.  Because we want to compare values of
type ‘T’ in the body, we can only use types whose values can be ordered.
To enable comparisons, the standard library has the
‘std::cmp::PartialOrd’ trait that you can implement on types (see
Appendix C for more on this trait).  By following the help text's
suggestion, we restrict the types valid for ‘T’ to only those that
implement ‘PartialOrd’ and this example will compile, because the
standard library implements ‘PartialOrd’ on both ‘i32’ and ‘char’.

13.1.1.2 In Struct Definitions
..............................

We can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or
more fields using the ‘<>’ syntax.  Listing 10-6 defines a ‘Point<T>’
struct to hold ‘x’ and ‘y’ coordinate values of any type.

struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}

The syntax for using generics in struct definitions is similar to that
used in function definitions.  First we declare the name of the type
parameter inside angle brackets just after the name of the struct.  Then
we use the generic type in the struct definition where we would
otherwise specify concrete data types.

Note that because we've used only one generic type to define ‘Point<T>’,
this definition says that the ‘Point<T>’ struct is generic over some
type ‘T’, and the fields ‘x’ and ‘y’ are ‘both’ that same type, whatever
that type may be.  If we create an instance of a ‘Point<T>’ that has
values of different types, as in Listing 10-7, our code won't compile.

struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}

In this example, when we assign the integer value ‘5’ to ‘x’, we let the
compiler know that the generic type ‘T’ will be an integer for this
instance of ‘Point<T>’.  Then when we specify ‘4.0’ for ‘y’, which we've
defined to have the same type as ‘x’, we'll get a type mismatch error
like this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0308]: mismatched types

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error

To define a ‘Point’ struct where ‘x’ and ‘y’ are both generics but could
have different types, we can use multiple generic type parameters.  For
example, in Listing 10-8, we change the definition of ‘Point’ to be
generic over types ‘T’ and ‘U’ where ‘x’ is of type ‘T’ and ‘y’ is of
type ‘U’.

struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}

Now all the instances of ‘Point’ shown are allowed!  You can use as many
generic type parameters in a definition as you want, but using more than
a few makes your code hard to read.  If you're finding you need lots of
generic types in your code, it could indicate that your code needs
restructuring into smaller pieces.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: In Enum Definitions,  Next: In Method Definitions,  Prev: In Struct Definitions,  Up: Generic Data Types

13.1.1.3 In Enum Definitions
............................

As we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types
in their variants.  Let's take another look at the ‘Option<T>’ enum that
the standard library provides, which we used in Chapter 6:

enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

This definition should now make more sense to you.  As you can see, the
‘Option<T>’ enum is generic over type ‘T’ and has two variants: ‘Some’,
which holds one value of type ‘T’, and a ‘None’ variant that doesn't
hold any value.  By using the ‘Option<T>’ enum, we can express the
abstract concept of an optional value, and because ‘Option<T>’ is
generic, we can use this abstraction no matter what the type of the
optional value is.

Enums can use multiple generic types as well.  The definition of the
‘Result’ enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}

The ‘Result’ enum is generic over two types, ‘T’ and ‘E’, and has two
variants: ‘Ok’, which holds a value of type ‘T’, and ‘Err’, which holds
a value of type ‘E’.  This definition makes it convenient to use the
‘Result’ enum anywhere we have an operation that might succeed (return a
value of some type ‘T’) or fail (return an error of some type ‘E’).  In
fact, this is what we used to open a file in Listing 9-3, where ‘T’ was
filled in with the type ‘std::fs::File’ when the file was opened
successfully and ‘E’ was filled in with the type ‘std::io::Error’ when
there were problems opening the file.

When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum
definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you
can avoid duplication by using generic types instead.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: In Method Definitions,  Next: Performance of Code Using Generics,  Prev: In Enum Definitions,  Up: Generic Data Types

13.1.1.4 In Method Definitions
..............................

We can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in Chapter 5)
and use generic types in their definitions too.  Listing 10-9 shows the
‘Point<T>’ struct we defined in Listing 10-6 with a method named ‘x’
implemented on it.

struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}

Here, we've defined a method named ‘x’ on ‘Point<T>’ that returns a
reference to the data in the field ‘x’.

Note that we have to declare ‘T’ just after ‘impl’ so we can use ‘T’ to
specify that we're implementing methods on the type ‘Point<T>’.  By
declaring ‘T’ as a generic type after ‘impl’, Rust can identify that the
type in the angle brackets in ‘Point’ is a generic type rather than a
concrete type.  We could have chosen a different name for this generic
parameter than the generic parameter declared in the struct definition,
but using the same name is conventional.  Methods written within an
‘impl’ that declares the generic type will be defined on any instance of
the type, no matter what concrete type ends up substituting for the
generic type.

We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods
on the type.  We could, for example, implement methods only on
‘Point<f32>’ instances rather than on ‘Point<T>’ instances with any
generic type.  In Listing 10-10 we use the concrete type ‘f32’, meaning
we don't declare any types after ‘impl’.

impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}

This code means the type ‘Point<f32>’ will have a ‘distance_from_origin’
method; other instances of ‘Point<T>’ where ‘T’ is not of type ‘f32’
will not have this method defined.  The method measures how far our
point is from the point at coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical
operations that are available only for floating-point types.

Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren't always the same as
those you use in that same struct's method signatures.  Listing 10-11
uses the generic types ‘X1’ and ‘Y1’ for the ‘Point’ struct and ‘X2’
‘Y2’ for the ‘mixup’ method signature to make the example clearer.  The
method creates a new ‘Point’ instance with the ‘x’ value from the ‘self’
‘Point’ (of type ‘X1’) and the ‘y’ value from the passed-in ‘Point’ (of
type ‘Y2’).

struct Point<X1, Y1> {
    x: X1,
    y: Y1,
}

impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}

In ‘main’, we've defined a ‘Point’ that has an ‘i32’ for ‘x’ (with value
‘5’) and an ‘f64’ for ‘y’ (with value ‘10.4’).  The ‘p2’ variable is a
‘Point’ struct that has a string slice for ‘x’ (with value ‘"Hello"’)
and a ‘char’ for ‘y’ (with value ‘c’).  Calling ‘mixup’ on ‘p1’ with the
argument ‘p2’ gives us ‘p3’, which will have an ‘i32’ for ‘x’ because
‘x’ came from ‘p1’.  The ‘p3’ variable will have a ‘char’ for ‘y’
because ‘y’ came from ‘p2’.  The ‘println!’ macro call will print ‘p3.x
= 5, p3.y = c’.

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which some
generic parameters are declared with ‘impl’ and some are declared with
the method definition.  Here, the generic parameters ‘X1’ and ‘Y1’ are
declared after ‘impl’ because they go with the struct definition.  The
generic parameters ‘X2’ and ‘Y2’ are declared after ‘fn mixup’ because
they're only relevant to the method.

13.1.1.5 Performance of Code Using Generics
...........................................

You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when using
generic type parameters.  The good news is that using generic types
won't make your program run any slower than it would with concrete
types.

Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using
generics at compile time.  ‘Monomorphization’ is the process of turning
generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that
are used when compiled.  In this process, the compiler does the opposite
of the steps we used to create the generic function in Listing 10-5: the
compiler looks at all the places where generic code is called and
generates code for the concrete types the generic code is called with.

Let's look at how this works by using the standard library's generic
‘Option<T>’ enum:

let integer = Some(5);
let float = Some(5.0);

When Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization.  During that
process, the compiler reads the values that have been used in
‘Option<T>’ instances and identifies two kinds of ‘Option<T>’: one is
‘i32’ and the other is ‘f64’.  As such, it expands the generic
definition of ‘Option<T>’ into two definitions specialized to ‘i32’ and
‘f64’, thereby replacing the generic definition with the specific ones.

The monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following
(the compiler uses different names than what we're using here for
illustration):

enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}

enum Option_f64 {
    Some(f64),
    None,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}

The generic ‘Option<T>’ is replaced with the specific definitions
created by the compiler.  Because Rust compiles generic code into code
that specifies the type in each instance, we pay no runtime cost for
using generics.  When the code runs, it performs just as it would if we
had duplicated each definition by hand.  The process of monomorphization
makes Rust's generics extremely efficient at runtime.

13.1.2 Traits: Defining Shared Behavior
---------------------------------------

A ‘trait’ defines the functionality a particular type has and can share
with other types.  We can use traits to define shared behavior in an
abstract way.  We can use ‘trait bounds’ to specify that a generic type
can be any type that has certain behavior.

Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called ‘interfaces’ in other
languages, although with some differences.

13.1.2.1 Defining a Trait
.........................

A type's behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type.
Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods
on all of those types.  Trait definitions are a way to group method
signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish
some purpose.

For example, let's say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds
and amounts of text: a ‘NewsArticle’ struct that holds a news story
filed in a particular location and a ‘Tweet’ that can have, at most, 280
characters along with metadata that indicates whether it was a new
tweet, a retweet, or a reply to another tweet.

We want to make a media aggregator library crate named ‘aggregator’ that
can display summaries of data that might be stored in a ‘NewsArticle’ or
‘Tweet’ instance.  To do this, we need a summary from each type, and
we'll request that summary by calling a ‘summarize’ method on an
instance.  Listing 10-12 shows the definition of a public ‘Summary’
trait that expresses this behavior.

pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

Here, we declare a trait using the ‘trait’ keyword and then the trait's
name, which is ‘Summary’ in this case.  We also declare the trait as
‘pub’ so that crates depending on this crate can make use of this trait
too, as we'll see in a few examples.  Inside the curly brackets, we
declare the method signatures that describe the behaviors of the types
that implement this trait, which in this case is ‘fn summarize(&self) ->
String’.

After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation
within curly brackets, we use a semicolon.  Each type implementing this
trait must provide its own custom behavior for the body of the method.
The compiler will enforce that any type that has the ‘Summary’ trait
will have the method ‘summarize’ defined with this signature exactly.

A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are
listed one per line, and each line ends in a semicolon.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Implementing a Trait on a Type,  Next: Default Implementations,  Prev: Defining a Trait,  Up: Traits Defining Shared Behavior

13.1.2.2 Implementing a Trait on a Type
.......................................

Now that we've defined the desired signatures of the ‘Summary’ trait's
methods, we can implement it on the types in our media aggregator.
Listing 10-13 shows an implementation of the ‘Summary’ trait on the
‘NewsArticle’ struct that uses the headline, the author, and the
location to create the return value of ‘summarize’.  For the ‘Tweet’
struct, we define ‘summarize’ as the username followed by the entire
text of the tweet, assuming that the tweet content is already limited to
280 characters.

pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}

Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular
methods.  The difference is that after ‘impl’, we put the trait name we
want to implement, then use the ‘for’ keyword, and then specify the name
of the type we want to implement the trait for.  Within the ‘impl’
block, we put the method signatures that the trait definition has
defined.  Instead of adding a semicolon after each signature, we use
curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific behavior
that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.

Now that the library has implemented the ‘Summary’ trait on
‘NewsArticle’ and ‘Tweet’, users of the crate can call the trait methods
on instances of ‘NewsArticle’ and ‘Tweet’ in the same way we call
regular methods.  The only difference is that the user must bring the
trait into scope as well as the types.  Here's an example of how a
binary crate could use our ‘aggregator’ library crate:

use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
}

This code prints ‘1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably
already know, people’.

Other crates that depend on the ‘aggregator’ crate can also bring the
‘Summary’ trait into scope to implement ‘Summary’ on their own types.
One restriction to note is that we can implement a trait on a type only
if either the trait or the type, or both, are local to our crate.  For
example, we can implement standard library traits like ‘Display’ on a
custom type like ‘Tweet’ as part of our ‘aggregator’ crate functionality
because the type ‘Tweet’ is local to our ‘aggregator’ crate.  We can
also implement ‘Summary’ on ‘Vec<T>’ in our ‘aggregator’ crate because
the trait ‘Summary’ is local to our ‘aggregator’ crate.

But we can't implement external traits on external types.  For example,
we can't implement the ‘Display’ trait on ‘Vec<T>’ within our
‘aggregator’ crate because ‘Display’ and ‘Vec<T>’ are both defined in
the standard library and aren't local to our ‘aggregator’ crate.  This
restriction is part of a property called ‘coherence’, and more
specifically the ‘orphan rule’, so named because the parent type is not
present.  This rule ensures that other people's code can't break your
code and vice versa.  Without the rule, two crates could implement the
same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn't know which
implementation to use.

13.1.2.3 Default Implementations
................................

Sometimes it's useful to have default behavior for some or all of the
methods in a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods
on every type.  Then, as we implement the trait on a particular type, we
can keep or override each method's default behavior.

In Listing 10-14, we specify a default string for the ‘summarize’ method
of the ‘Summary’ trait instead of only defining the method signature, as
we did in Listing 10-12.

pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}

To use a default implementation to summarize instances of ‘NewsArticle’,
we specify an empty ‘impl’ block with ‘impl Summary for NewsArticle {}’.

Even though we're no longer defining the ‘summarize’ method on
‘NewsArticle’ directly, we've provided a default implementation and
specified that ‘NewsArticle’ implements the ‘Summary’ trait.  As a
result, we can still call the ‘summarize’ method on an instance of
‘NewsArticle’, like this:

    let article = NewsArticle {
        headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
        location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
        author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
        content: String::from(
            "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
             hockey team in the NHL.",
        ),
    };

    println!("New article available! {}", article.summarize());

This code prints ‘New article available! (Read more...)’.

Creating a default implementation doesn't require us to change anything
about the implementation of ‘Summary’ on ‘Tweet’ in Listing 10-13.  The
reason is that the syntax for overriding a default implementation is the
same as the syntax for implementing a trait method that doesn't have a
default implementation.

Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even
if those other methods don't have a default implementation.  In this
way, a trait can provide a lot of useful functionality and only require
implementors to specify a small part of it.  For example, we could
define the ‘Summary’ trait to have a ‘summarize_author’ method whose
implementation is required, and then define a ‘summarize’ method that
has a default implementation that calls the ‘summarize_author’ method:

pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}

To use this version of ‘Summary’, we only need to define
‘summarize_author’ when we implement the trait on a type:

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}

After we define ‘summarize_author’, we can call ‘summarize’ on instances
of the ‘Tweet’ struct, and the default implementation of ‘summarize’
will call the definition of ‘summarize_author’ that we've provided.
Because we've implemented ‘summarize_author’, the ‘Summary’ trait has
given us the behavior of the ‘summarize’ method without requiring us to
write any more code.  Here's what that looks like:

    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());

This code prints ‘1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)’.

Note that it isn't possible to call the default implementation from an
overriding implementation of that same method.

13.1.2.4 Traits as Parameters
.............................

Now that you know how to define and implement traits, we can explore how
to use traits to define functions that accept many different types.
We'll use the ‘Summary’ trait we implemented on the ‘NewsArticle’ and
‘Tweet’ types in Listing 10-13 to define a ‘notify’ function that calls
the ‘summarize’ method on its ‘item’ parameter, which is of some type
that implements the ‘Summary’ trait.  To do this, we use the ‘impl
Trait’ syntax, like this:

pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}

Instead of a concrete type for the ‘item’ parameter, we specify the
‘impl’ keyword and the trait name.  This parameter accepts any type that
implements the specified trait.  In the body of ‘notify’, we can call
any methods on ‘item’ that come from the ‘Summary’ trait, such as
‘summarize’.  We can call ‘notify’ and pass in any instance of
‘NewsArticle’ or ‘Tweet’.  Code that calls the function with any other
type, such as a ‘String’ or an ‘i32’, won't compile because those types
don't implement ‘Summary’.  Trait Bound Syntax The ‘impl Trait’ syntax
works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax sugar for a
longer form known as a ‘trait bound’; it looks like this:

pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}

This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section
but is more verbose.  We place trait bounds with the declaration of the
generic type parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.

The ‘impl Trait’ syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in
simple cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more
complexity in other cases.  For example, we can have two parameters that
implement ‘Summary’.  Doing so with the ‘impl Trait’ syntax looks like
this:

pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {

Using ‘impl Trait’ is appropriate if we want this function to allow
‘item1’ and ‘item2’ to have different types (as long as both types
implement ‘Summary’).  If we want to force both parameters to have the
same type, however, we must use a trait bound, like this:

pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {

The generic type ‘T’ specified as the type of the ‘item1’ and ‘item2’
parameters constrains the function such that the concrete type of the
value passed as an argument for ‘item1’ and ‘item2’ must be the same.
Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the ‘+’ Syntax We can also specify
more than one trait bound.  Say we wanted ‘notify’ to use display
formatting as well as ‘summarize’ on ‘item’: we specify in the ‘notify’
definition that ‘item’ must implement both ‘Display’ and ‘Summary’.  We
can do so using the ‘+’ syntax:

pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {

The ‘+’ syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:

pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {

With the two trait bounds specified, the body of ‘notify’ can call
‘summarize’ and use ‘{}’ to format ‘item’.  Clearer Trait Bounds with
‘where’ Clauses Using too many trait bounds has its downsides.  Each
generic has its own trait bounds, so functions with multiple generic
type parameters can contain lots of trait bound information between the
function's name and its parameter list, making the function signature
hard to read.  For this reason, Rust has alternate syntax for specifying
trait bounds inside a ‘where’ clause after the function signature.  So,
instead of writing this:

fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {

we can use a ‘where’ clause, like this:

fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{

This function's signature is less cluttered: the function name,
parameter list, and return type are close together, similar to a
function without lots of trait bounds.

13.1.2.5 Returning Types That Implement Traits
..............................................

We can also use the ‘impl Trait’ syntax in the return position to return
a value of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:

fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}

By using ‘impl Summary’ for the return type, we specify that the
‘returns_summarizable’ function returns some type that implements the
‘Summary’ trait without naming the concrete type.  In this case,
‘returns_summarizable’ returns a ‘Tweet’, but the code calling this
function doesn't need to know that.

The ability to specify a return type only by the trait it implements is
especially useful in the context of closures and iterators, which we
cover in Chapter 13.  Closures and iterators create types that only the
compiler knows or types that are very long to specify.  The ‘impl Trait’
syntax lets you concisely specify that a function returns some type that
implements the ‘Iterator’ trait without needing to write out a very long
type.

However, you can only use ‘impl Trait’ if you're returning a single
type.  For example, this code that returns either a ‘NewsArticle’ or a
‘Tweet’ with the return type specified as ‘impl Summary’ wouldn't work:

fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
    if switch {
        NewsArticle {
            headline: String::from(
                "Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!",
            ),
            location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
            author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
            content: String::from(
                "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
                 hockey team in the NHL.",
            ),
        }
    } else {
        Tweet {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            retweet: false,
        }
    }
}

Returning either a ‘NewsArticle’ or a ‘Tweet’ isn't allowed due to
restrictions around how the ‘impl Trait’ syntax is implemented in the
compiler.  We'll cover how to write a function with this behavior in the
*note “Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types”:
Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types. section of
Chapter 18.

13.1.2.6 Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods
..............................................................

By using a trait bound with an ‘impl’ block that uses generic type
parameters, we can implement methods conditionally for types that
implement the specified traits.  For example, the type ‘Pair<T>’ in
Listing 10-15 always implements the ‘new’ function to return a new
instance of ‘Pair<T>’ (recall from the *note “Defining Methods”:
Defining Methods. section of Chapter 5 that ‘Self’ is a type alias for
the type of the ‘impl’ block, which in this case is ‘Pair<T>’).  But in
the next ‘impl’ block, ‘Pair<T>’ only implements the ‘cmp_display’
method if its inner type ‘T’ implements the ‘PartialOrd’ trait that
enables comparison ‘and’ the ‘Display’ trait that enables printing.

use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Pair<T> {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
    fn cmp_display(&self) {
        if self.x >= self.y {
            println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
        } else {
            println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
        }
    }
}

We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements
another trait.  Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies
the trait bounds are called ‘blanket implementations’ and are used
extensively in the Rust standard library.  For example, the standard
library implements the ‘ToString’ trait on any type that implements the
‘Display’ trait.  The ‘impl’ block in the standard library looks similar
to this code:

impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}

Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can
call the ‘to_string’ method defined by the ‘ToString’ trait on any type
that implements the ‘Display’ trait.  For example, we can turn integers
into their corresponding ‘String’ values like this because integers
implement ‘Display’:

let s = 3.to_string();

Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the
“Implementors” section.

Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type
parameters to reduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that
we want the generic type to have particular behavior.  The compiler can
then use the trait bound information to check that all the concrete
types used with our code provide the correct behavior.  In dynamically
typed languages, we would get an error at runtime if we called a method
on a type which didn't define the method.  But Rust moves these errors
to compile time so we're forced to fix the problems before our code is
even able to run.  Additionally, we don't have to write code that checks
for behavior at runtime because we've already checked at compile time.
Doing so improves performance without having to give up the flexibility
of generics.

13.1.3 Validating References with Lifetimes
-------------------------------------------

Lifetimes are another kind of generic that we've already been using.
Rather than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes
ensure that references are valid as long as we need them to be.

One detail we didn't discuss in the *note “References and Borrowing”:
References and Borrowing. section in Chapter 4 is that every reference
in Rust has a ‘lifetime’, which is the scope for which that reference is
valid.  Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like
most of the time, types are inferred.  We must annotate types only when
multiple types are possible.  In a similar way, we must annotate
lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few
different ways.  Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using
generic lifetime parameters to ensure the actual references used at
runtime will definitely be valid.

Annotating lifetimes is not a concept most other programming languages
have, so this is going to feel unfamiliar.  Although we won't cover
lifetimes in their entirety in this chapter, we'll discuss common ways
you might encounter lifetime syntax so you can get comfortable with the
concept.

13.1.3.1 Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes
......................................................

The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent ‘dangling references’, which
cause a program to reference data other than the data it's intended to
reference.  Consider the program in Listing 10-16, which has an outer
scope and an inner scope.

fn main() {
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    println!("r: {r}");
}

Note: The examples in Listing 10-16, 10-17, and 10-23 declare variables
without giving them an initial value, so the variable name exists in the
outer scope.  At first glance, this might appear to be in conflict with
Rust's having no null values.  However, if we try to use a variable
before giving it a value, we'll get a compile-time error, which shows
that Rust indeed does not allow null values.

The outer scope declares a variable named ‘r’ with no initial value, and
the inner scope declares a variable named ‘x’ with the initial value of
‘5’.  Inside the inner scope, we attempt to set the value of ‘r’ as a
reference to ‘x’.  Then the inner scope ends, and we attempt to print
the value in ‘r’.  This code won't compile because the value that ‘r’ is
referring to has gone out of scope before we try to use it.  Here is the
error message:

$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0597]: `x` does not live long enough

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error

The error message says that the variable ‘x’ “does not live long
enough.” The reason is that ‘x’ will be out of scope when the inner
scope ends on line 7.  But ‘r’ is still valid for the outer scope;
because its scope is larger, we say that it “lives longer.” If Rust
allowed this code to work, ‘r’ would be referencing memory that was
deallocated when ‘x’ went out of scope, and anything we tried to do with
‘r’ wouldn't work correctly.  So how does Rust determine that this code
is invalid?  It uses a borrow checker.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: The Borrow Checker,  Next: Generic Lifetimes in Functions,  Prev: Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes,  Up: Validating References with Lifetimes

13.1.3.2 The Borrow Checker
...........................

The Rust compiler has a ‘borrow checker’ that compares scopes to
determine whether all borrows are valid.  Listing 10-17 shows the same
code as Listing 10-16 but with annotations showing the lifetimes of the
variables.

fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           //  |       |
    }                     // -+       |
                          //          |
    println!("r: {r}");   //          |
}                         // ---------+

Here, we've annotated the lifetime of ‘r’ with ‘'a’ and the lifetime of
‘x’ with ‘'b’.  As you can see, the inner ‘'b’ block is much smaller
than the outer ‘'a’ lifetime block.  At compile time, Rust compares the
size of the two lifetimes and sees that ‘r’ has a lifetime of ‘'a’ but
that it refers to memory with a lifetime of ‘'b’.  The program is
rejected because ‘'b’ is shorter than ‘'a’: the subject of the reference
doesn't live as long as the reference.

Listing 10-18 fixes the code so it doesn't have a dangling reference and
it compiles without any errors.

fn main() {
    let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                          //           |
    let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                          //   |       |
    println!("r: {r}");   //   |       |
                          // --+       |
}                         // ----------+

Here, ‘x’ has the lifetime ‘'b’, which in this case is larger than ‘'a’.
This means ‘r’ can reference ‘x’ because Rust knows that the reference
in ‘r’ will always be valid while ‘x’ is valid.

Now that you know what the lifetimes of references are and how Rust
analyzes lifetimes to ensure references will always be valid, let's
explore generic lifetimes of parameters and return values in the context
of functions.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Generic Lifetimes in Functions,  Next: Lifetime Annotation Syntax,  Prev: The Borrow Checker,  Up: Validating References with Lifetimes

13.1.3.3 Generic Lifetimes in Functions
.......................................

We'll write a function that returns the longer of two string slices.
This function will take two string slices and return a single string
slice.  After we've implemented the ‘longest’ function, the code in
Listing 10-19 should print ‘The longest string is abcd’.

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
    println!("The longest string is {result}");
}

Note that we want the function to take string slices, which are
references, rather than strings, because we don't want the ‘longest’
function to take ownership of its parameters.  Refer to the *note
“String Slices as Parameters”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch04-03-slicesmd__string-slices-as-parameters.
section in Chapter 4 for more discussion about why the parameters we use
in Listing 10-19 are the ones we want.

If we try to implement the ‘longest’ function as shown in Listing 10-20,
it won't compile.

fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

Instead, we get the following error that talks about lifetimes:

$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:9:33

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0106`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error

The help text reveals that the return type needs a generic lifetime
parameter on it because Rust can't tell whether the reference being
returned refers to ‘x’ or ‘y’.  Actually, we don't know either, because
the ‘if’ block in the body of this function returns a reference to ‘x’
and the ‘else’ block returns a reference to ‘y’!

When we're defining this function, we don't know the concrete values
that will be passed into this function, so we don't know whether the
‘if’ case or the ‘else’ case will execute.  We also don't know the
concrete lifetimes of the references that will be passed in, so we can't
look at the scopes as we did in Listings 10-17 and 10-18 to determine
whether the reference we return will always be valid.  The borrow
checker can't determine this either, because it doesn't know how the
lifetimes of ‘x’ and ‘y’ relate to the lifetime of the return value.  To
fix this error, we'll add generic lifetime parameters that define the
relationship between the references so the borrow checker can perform
its analysis.

13.1.3.4 Lifetime Annotation Syntax
...................................

Lifetime annotations don't change how long any of the references live.
Rather, they describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple
references to each other without affecting the lifetimes.  Just as
functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a generic
type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime by
specifying a generic lifetime parameter.

Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of
lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophe (‘'’) and are usually
all lowercase and very short, like generic types.  Most people use the
name ‘'a’ for the first lifetime annotation.  We place lifetime
parameter annotations after the ‘&’ of a reference, using a space to
separate the annotation from the reference's type.

Here are some examples: a reference to an ‘i32’ without a lifetime
parameter, a reference to an ‘i32’ that has a lifetime parameter named
‘'a’, and a mutable reference to an ‘i32’ that also has the lifetime
‘'a’.

&i32        // a reference
&'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime

One lifetime annotation by itself doesn't have much meaning because the
annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of
multiple references relate to each other.  Let's examine how the
lifetime annotations relate to each other in the context of the
‘longest’ function.

13.1.3.5 Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures
....................................................

To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare
the generic ‘lifetime’ parameters inside angle brackets between the
function name and the parameter list, just as we did with generic ‘type’
parameters.

We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned
reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid.  This
is the relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return
value.  We'll name the lifetime ‘'a’ and then add it to each reference,
as shown in Listing 10-21.

fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

This code should compile and produce the result we want when we use it
with the ‘main’ function in Listing 10-19.

The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime ‘'a’, the
function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live
at least as long as lifetime ‘'a’.  The function signature also tells
Rust that the string slice returned from the function will live at least
as long as lifetime ‘'a’.  In practice, it means that the lifetime of
the reference returned by the ‘longest’ function is the same as the
smaller of the lifetimes of the values referred to by the function
arguments.  These relationships are what we want Rust to use when
analyzing this code.

Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function
signature, we're not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or
returned.  Rather, we're specifying that the borrow checker should
reject any values that don't adhere to these constraints.  Note that the
‘longest’ function doesn't need to know exactly how long ‘x’ and ‘y’
will live, only that some scope can be substituted for ‘'a’ that will
satisfy this signature.

When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the
function signature, not in the function body.  The lifetime annotations
become part of the contract of the function, much like the types in the
signature.  Having function signatures contain the lifetime contract
means the analysis the Rust compiler does can be simpler.  If there's a
problem with the way a function is annotated or the way it is called,
the compiler errors can point to the part of our code and the
constraints more precisely.  If, instead, the Rust compiler made more
inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes to
be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many
steps away from the cause of the problem.

When we pass concrete references to ‘longest’, the concrete lifetime
that is substituted for ‘'a’ is the part of the scope of ‘x’ that
overlaps with the scope of ‘y’.  In other words, the generic lifetime
‘'a’ will get the concrete lifetime that is equal to the smaller of the
lifetimes of ‘x’ and ‘y’.  Because we've annotated the returned
reference with the same lifetime parameter ‘'a’, the returned reference
will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the lifetimes of ‘x’
and ‘y’.

Let's look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the ‘longest’
function by passing in references that have different concrete
lifetimes.  Listing 10-22 is a straightforward example.

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");

    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
        println!("The longest string is {result}");
    }
}

In this example, ‘string1’ is valid until the end of the outer scope,
‘string2’ is valid until the end of the inner scope, and ‘result’
references something that is valid until the end of the inner scope.
Run this code and you'll see that the borrow checker approves; it will
compile and print ‘The longest string is long string is long’.

Next, let's try an example that shows that the lifetime of the reference
in ‘result’ must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments.  We'll
move the declaration of the ‘result’ variable outside the inner scope
but leave the assignment of the value to the ‘result’ variable inside
the scope with ‘string2’.  Then we'll move the ‘println!’ that uses
‘result’ to outside the inner scope, after the inner scope has ended.
The code in Listing 10-23 will not compile.

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    println!("The longest string is {result}");
}

When we try to compile this code, we get this error:

$ cargo run

error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error

The error shows that for ‘result’ to be valid for the ‘println!’
statement, ‘string2’ would need to be valid until the end of the outer
scope.  Rust knows this because we annotated the lifetimes of the
function parameters and return values using the same lifetime parameter
‘'a’.

As humans, we can look at this code and see that ‘string1’ is longer
than ‘string2’, and therefore, ‘result’ will contain a reference to
‘string1’.  Because ‘string1’ has not gone out of scope yet, a reference
to ‘string1’ will still be valid for the ‘println!’ statement.  However,
the compiler can't see that the reference is valid in this case.  We've
told Rust that the lifetime of the reference returned by the ‘longest’
function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the references
passed in.  Therefore, the borrow checker disallows the code in Listing
10-23 as possibly having an invalid reference.

Try designing more experiments that vary the values and lifetimes of the
references passed in to the ‘longest’ function and how the returned
reference is used.  Make hypotheses about whether or not your
experiments will pass the borrow checker before you compile; then check
to see if you're right!

13.1.3.6 Thinking in Terms of Lifetimes
.......................................

The way in which you need to specify lifetime parameters depends on what
your function is doing.  For example, if we changed the implementation
of the ‘longest’ function to always return the first parameter rather
than the longest string slice, we wouldn't need to specify a lifetime on
the ‘y’ parameter.  The following code will compile:

fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
    x
}

We've specified a lifetime parameter ‘'a’ for the parameter ‘x’ and the
return type, but not for the parameter ‘y’, because the lifetime of ‘y’
does not have any relationship with the lifetime of ‘x’ or the return
value.

When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for
the return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the
parameters.  If the reference returned does ‘not’ refer to one of the
parameters, it must refer to a value created within this function.
However, this would be a dangling reference because the value will go
out of scope at the end of the function.  Consider this attempted
implementation of the ‘longest’ function that won't compile:

fn longest<'a>(x: &str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
    let result = String::from("really long string");
    result.as_str()
}

Here, even though we've specified a lifetime parameter ‘'a’ for the
return type, this implementation will fail to compile because the return
value lifetime is not related to the lifetime of the parameters at all.
Here is the error message we get:

$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0515]: cannot return value referencing local variable `result`
  --> src/main.rs:11:5

   |     ------^^^^^^^^^

   |     `result` is borrowed here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0515`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error

The problem is that ‘result’ goes out of scope and gets cleaned up at
the end of the ‘longest’ function.  We're also trying to return a
reference to ‘result’ from the function.  There is no way we can specify
lifetime parameters that would change the dangling reference, and Rust
won't let us create a dangling reference.  In this case, the best fix
would be to return an owned data type rather than a reference so the
calling function is then responsible for cleaning up the value.

Ultimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various
parameters and return values of functions.  Once they're connected, Rust
has enough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow
operations that would create dangling pointers or otherwise violate
memory safety.

13.1.3.7 Lifetime Annotations in Struct Definitions
...................................................

So far, the structs we've defined all hold owned types.  We can define
structs to hold references, but in that case we would need to add a
lifetime annotation on every reference in the struct's definition.
Listing 10-24 has a struct named ‘ImportantExcerpt’ that holds a string
slice.

struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().unwrap();
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    };
}

This struct has the single field ‘part’ that holds a string slice, which
is a reference.  As with generic data types, we declare the name of the
generic lifetime parameter inside angle brackets after the name of the
struct so we can use the lifetime parameter in the body of the struct
definition.  This annotation means an instance of ‘ImportantExcerpt’
can't outlive the reference it holds in its ‘part’ field.

The ‘main’ function here creates an instance of the ‘ImportantExcerpt’
struct that holds a reference to the first sentence of the ‘String’
owned by the variable ‘novel’.  The data in ‘novel’ exists before the
‘ImportantExcerpt’ instance is created.  In addition, ‘novel’ doesn't go
out of scope until after the ‘ImportantExcerpt’ goes out of scope, so
the reference in the ‘ImportantExcerpt’ instance is valid.

13.1.3.8 Lifetime Elision
.........................

You've learned that every reference has a lifetime and that you need to
specify lifetime parameters for functions or structs that use
references.  However, we had a function in Listing 4-9, shown again in
Listing 10-25, that compiled without lifetime annotations.

fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}

The reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is
historical: in early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wouldn't have
compiled because every reference needed an explicit lifetime.  At that
time, the function signature would have been written like this:

fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {

After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust
programmers were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in
particular situations.  These situations were predictable and followed a
few deterministic patterns.  The developers programmed these patterns
into the compiler's code so the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes
in these situations and wouldn't need explicit annotations.

This piece of Rust history is relevant because it's possible that more
deterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler.  In the
future, even fewer lifetime annotations might be required.

The patterns programmed into Rust's analysis of references are called
the ‘lifetime elision rules’.  These aren't rules for programmers to
follow; they're a set of particular cases that the compiler will
consider, and if your code fits these cases, you don't need to write the
lifetimes explicitly.

The elision rules don't provide full inference.  If there is still
ambiguity as to what lifetimes the references have after Rust applies
the rules, the compiler won't guess what the lifetime of the remaining
references should be.  Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you
an error that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.

Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called ‘input lifetimes’,
and lifetimes on return values are called ‘output lifetimes’.

The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the
references when there aren't explicit annotations.  The first rule
applies to input lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to
output lifetimes.  If the compiler gets to the end of the three rules
and there are still references for which it can't figure out lifetimes,
the compiler will stop with an error.  These rules apply to ‘fn’
definitions as well as ‘impl’ blocks.

The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each
parameter that's a reference.  In other words, a function with one
parameter gets one lifetime parameter: ‘fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)’; a
function with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: ‘fn
foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)’; and so on.

The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime
parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters:
‘fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32’.

The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters,
but one of them is ‘&self’ or ‘&mut self’ because this is a method, the
lifetime of ‘self’ is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.  This
third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer
symbols are necessary.

Let's pretend we're the compiler.  We'll apply these rules to figure out
the lifetimes of the references in the signature of the ‘first_word’
function in Listing 10-25.  The signature starts without any lifetimes
associated with the references:

fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {

Then the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each
parameter gets its own lifetime.  We'll call it ‘'a’ as usual, so now
the signature is this:

fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {

The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime.
The second rule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter
gets assigned to the output lifetime, so the signature is now this:

fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {

Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and
the compiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to
annotate the lifetimes in this function signature.

Let's look at another example, this time using the ‘longest’ function
that had no lifetime parameters when we started working with it in
Listing 10-20:

fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {

Let's apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime.  This
time we have two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:

fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {

You can see that the second rule doesn't apply because there is more
than one input lifetime.  The third rule doesn't apply either, because
‘longest’ is a function rather than a method, so none of the parameters
are ‘self’.  After working through all three rules, we still haven't
figured out what the return type's lifetime is.  This is why we got an
error trying to compile the code in Listing 10-20: the compiler worked
through the lifetime elision rules but still couldn't figure out all the
lifetimes of the references in the signature.

Because the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we'll
look at lifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means
we don't have to annotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.

13.1.3.9 Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions
...................................................

When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, we use the same
syntax as that of generic type parameters shown in Listing 10-11.  Where
we declare and use the lifetime parameters depends on whether they're
related to the struct fields or the method parameters and return values.

Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the
‘impl’ keyword and then used after the struct's name because those
lifetimes are part of the struct's type.

In method signatures inside the ‘impl’ block, references might be tied
to the lifetime of references in the struct's fields, or they might be
independent.  In addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so
that lifetime annotations aren't necessary in method signatures.  Let's
look at some examples using the struct named ‘ImportantExcerpt’ that we
defined in Listing 10-24.

First we'll use a method named ‘level’ whose only parameter is a
reference to ‘self’ and whose return value is an ‘i32’, which is not a
reference to anything:

impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    fn level(&self) -> i32 {
        3
    }
}

The lifetime parameter declaration after ‘impl’ and its use after the
type name are required, but we're not required to annotate the lifetime
of the reference to ‘self’ because of the first elision rule.

Here is an example where the third lifetime elision rule applies:

impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    fn announce_and_return_part(&self, announcement: &str) -> &str {
        println!("Attention please: {announcement}");
        self.part
    }
}

There are two input lifetimes, so Rust applies the first lifetime
elision rule and gives both ‘&self’ and ‘announcement’ their own
lifetimes.  Then, because one of the parameters is ‘&self’, the return
type gets the lifetime of ‘&self’, and all lifetimes have been accounted
for.

13.1.3.10 The Static Lifetime
.............................

One special lifetime we need to discuss is ‘'static’, which denotes that
the affected reference ‘can’ live for the entire duration of the
program.  All string literals have the ‘'static’ lifetime, which we can
annotate as follows:

let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";

The text of this string is stored directly in the program's binary,
which is always available.  Therefore, the lifetime of all string
literals is ‘'static’.

You might see suggestions to use the ‘'static’ lifetime in error
messages.  But before specifying ‘'static’ as the lifetime for a
reference, think about whether the reference you have actually lives the
entire lifetime of your program or not, and whether you want it to.
Most of the time, an error message suggesting the ‘'static’ lifetime
results from attempting to create a dangling reference or a mismatch of
the available lifetimes.  In such cases, the solution is to fix those
problems, not to specify the ‘'static’ lifetime.

13.1.4 Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes
-----------------------------------------------------------

Together Let's briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type
parameters, trait bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!

use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str,
    ann: T,
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {ann}");
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

This is the ‘longest’ function from Listing 10-21 that returns the
longer of two string slices.  But now it has an extra parameter named
‘ann’ of the generic type ‘T’, which can be filled in by any type that
implements the ‘Display’ trait as specified by the ‘where’ clause.  This
extra parameter will be printed using ‘{}’, which is why the ‘Display’
trait bound is necessary.  Because lifetimes are a type of generic, the
declarations of the lifetime parameter ‘'a’ and the generic type
parameter ‘T’ go in the same list inside the angle brackets after the
function name.

13.1.5 Summary
--------------

We covered a lot in this chapter!  Now that you know about generic type
parameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters,
you're ready to write code without repetition that works in many
different situations.  Generic type parameters let you apply the code to
different types.  Traits and trait bounds ensure that even though the
types are generic, they'll have the behavior the code needs.  You
learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure that this flexible
code won't have any dangling references.  And all of this analysis
happens at compile time, which doesn't affect runtime performance!

Believe it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we
discussed in this chapter: Chapter 18 discusses trait objects, which are
another way to use traits.  There are also more complex scenarios
involving lifetime annotations that you will only need in very advanced
scenarios; for those, you should read the Rust Reference
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../reference/index.html).  But next,
you'll learn how to write tests in Rust so you can make sure your code
is working the way it should.

14 Writing Automated Tests
**************************

In his 1972 essay “The Humble Programmer,” Edsger W. Dijkstra said that
“Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of
bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.” That
doesn't mean we shouldn't try to test as much as we can!

Correctness in our programs is the extent to which our code does what we
intend it to do.  Rust is designed with a high degree of concern about
the correctness of programs, but correctness is complex and not easy to
prove.  Rust's type system shoulders a huge part of this burden, but the
type system cannot catch everything.  As such, Rust includes support for
writing automated software tests.

Say we write a function ‘add_two’ that adds 2 to whatever number is
passed to it.  This function's signature accepts an integer as a
parameter and returns an integer as a result.  When we implement and
compile that function, Rust does all the type checking and borrow
checking that you've learned so far to ensure that, for instance, we
aren't passing a ‘String’ value or an invalid reference to this
function.  But Rust ‘can't’ check that this function will do precisely
what we intend, which is return the parameter plus 2 rather than, say,
the parameter plus 10 or the parameter minus 50!  That's where tests
come in.

We can write tests that assert, for example, that when we pass ‘3’ to
the ‘add_two’ function, the returned value is ‘5’.  We can run these
tests whenever we make changes to our code to make sure any existing
correct behavior has not changed.

Testing is a complex skill: although we can't cover in one chapter every
detail about how to write good tests, in this chapter we will discuss
the mechanics of Rust's testing facilities.  We'll talk about the
annotations and macros available to you when writing your tests, the
default behavior and options provided for running your tests, and how to
organize tests into unit tests and integration tests.

14.1 How to Write Tests
=======================

Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is
functioning in the expected manner.  The bodies of test functions
typically perform these three actions:

   • Set up any needed data or state.
   • Run the code you want to test.
   • Assert that the results are what you expect.

Let's look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests
that take these actions, which include the ‘test’ attribute, a few
macros, and the ‘should_panic’ attribute.

14.1.1 The Anatomy of a Test Function
-------------------------------------

At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that's annotated with the
‘test’ attribute.  Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code;
one example is the ‘derive’ attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5.
To change a function into a test function, add ‘#[test]’ on the line
before ‘fn’.  When you run your tests with the ‘cargo test’ command,
Rust builds a test runner binary that runs the annotated functions and
reports on whether each test function passes or fails.

Whenever we make a new library project with Cargo, a test module with a
test function in it is automatically generated for us.  This module
gives you a template for writing your tests so you don't have to look up
the exact structure and syntax every time you start a new project.  You
can add as many additional test functions and as many test modules as
you want!

We'll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the
template test before we actually test any code.  Then we'll write some
real-world tests that call some code that we've written and assert that
its behavior is correct.

Let's create a new library project called ‘adder’ that will add two
numbers:

$ cargo new adder --lib
     Created library `adder` project
$ cd adder

The contents of the ‘src/lib.rs’ file in your ‘adder’ library should
look like Listing 11-1.

pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -> u64 {
    left + right
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}

For now, let's focus solely on the ‘it_works’ function.  Note the
‘#[test]’ annotation: this attribute indicates this is a test function,
so the test runner knows to treat this function as a test.  We might
also have non-test functions in the ‘tests’ module to help set up common
scenarios or perform common operations, so we always need to indicate
which functions are tests.

The example function body uses the ‘assert_eq!’ macro to assert that
‘result’, which contains the result of adding 2 and 2, equals 4.  This
assertion serves as an example of the format for a typical test.  Let's
run it to see that this test passes.

The ‘cargo test’ command runs all tests in our project, as shown in
Listing 11-2.

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.57s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (file:///projects/adder/target/debug/deps/adder-7acb243c25ffd9dc)

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Cargo compiled and ran the test.  We see the line ‘running 1 test’.  The
next line shows the name of the generated test function, called
‘tests::it_works’, and that the result of running that test is ‘ok’.
The overall summary ‘test result: ok.’ means that all the tests passed,
and the portion that reads ‘1 passed; 0 failed’ totals the number of
tests that passed or failed.

It's possible to mark a test as ignored so it doesn't run in a
particular instance; we'll cover that in the *note “Ignoring Some Tests
Unless Specifically Requested”: Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically
Requested. section later in this chapter.  Because we haven't done that
here, the summary shows ‘0 ignored’.

The ‘0 measured’ statistic is for benchmark tests that measure
performance.  Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in
nightly Rust.  See the documentation about benchmark tests
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../unstable-book/library-features/test.html)
to learn more.

We can pass an argument to the ‘cargo test’ command to run only tests
whose name matches a string; this is called ‘filtering’ and we'll cover
that in the *note “Running a Subset of Tests by Name”: Running a Subset
of Tests by Name. section.  Here we haven't filtered the tests being
run, so the end of the summary shows ‘0 filtered out’.

The next part of the test output starting at ‘Doc-tests adder’ is for
the results of any documentation tests.  We don't have any documentation
tests yet, but Rust can compile any code examples that appear in our API
documentation.  This feature helps keep your docs and your code in sync!
We'll discuss how to write documentation tests in the *note
“Documentation Comments as Tests”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-iomd__documentation-comments-as-tests.
section of Chapter 14.  For now, we'll ignore the ‘Doc-tests’ output.

Let's start to customize the test to our own needs.  First, change the
name of the ‘it_works’ function to a different name, such as
‘exploration’, like so:

Filename: src/lib.rs

pub fn add(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn exploration() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}

Then run ‘cargo test’ again.  The output now shows ‘exploration’ instead
of ‘it_works’:

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

running 1 test
test tests::exploration ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Now we'll add another test, but this time we'll make a test that fails!
Tests fail when something in the test function panics.  Each test is run
in a new thread, and when the main thread sees that a test thread has
died, the test is marked as failed.  In Chapter 9, we talked about how
the simplest way to panic is to call the ‘panic!’ macro.  Enter the new
test as a function named ‘another’, so your ‘src/lib.rs’ file looks like
Listing 11-3.

pub fn add(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn exploration() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }

    fn another() {
        panic!("Make this test fail");
    }
}

Run the tests again using ‘cargo test’.  The output should look like
Listing 11-4, which shows that our ‘exploration’ test passed and
‘another’ failed.

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.72s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

failures:
    tests::another

test result: FAILED. 1 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

error: test failed, to rerun pass `--lib`

Instead of ‘ok’, the line ‘test tests::another’ shows ‘FAILED’.  Two new
sections appear between the individual results and the summary: the
first displays the detailed reason for each test failure.  In this case,
we get the details that ‘another’ failed because it ‘panicked at 'Make
this test fail'’ on line 17 in the ‘src/lib.rs’ file.  The next section
lists just the names of all the failing tests, which is useful when
there are lots of tests and lots of detailed failing test output.  We
can use the name of a failing test to run just that test to more easily
debug it; we'll talk more about ways to run tests in the *note
“Controlling How Tests Are Run”: Controlling How Tests Are Run. section.

The summary line displays at the end: overall, our test result is
‘FAILED’.  We had one test pass and one test fail.

Now that you've seen what the test results look like in different
scenarios, let's look at some macros other than ‘panic!’ that are useful
in tests.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Checking Results with the assert! Macro,  Next: Testing Equality with the assert_eq! and assert_ne! Macros,  Prev: The Anatomy of a Test Function,  Up: How to Write Tests

14.1.1.1 Checking Results with the ‘assert!’ Macro
..................................................

The ‘assert!’ macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when
you want to ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to ‘true’.
We give the ‘assert!’ macro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean.  If
the value is ‘true’, nothing happens and the test passes.  If the value
is ‘false’, the ‘assert!’ macro calls ‘panic!’ to cause the test to
fail.  Using the ‘assert!’ macro helps us check that our code is
functioning in the way we intend.

In Chapter 5, Listing 5-15, we used a ‘Rectangle’ struct and a
‘can_hold’ method, which are repeated here in Listing 11-5.  Let's put
this code in the ‘src/lib.rs’ file, then write some tests for it using
the ‘assert!’ macro.

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

The ‘can_hold’ method returns a Boolean, which means it's a perfect use
case for the ‘assert!’ macro.  In Listing 11-6, we write a test that
exercises the ‘can_hold’ method by creating a ‘Rectangle’ instance that
has a width of 8 and a height of 7 and asserting that it can hold
another ‘Rectangle’ instance that has a width of 5 and a height of 1.

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn larger_can_hold_smaller() {
        let larger = Rectangle {
            width: 8,
            height: 7,
        };
        let smaller = Rectangle {
            width: 5,
            height: 1,
        };

        assert!(larger.can_hold(&smaller));
    }
}

Note the ‘use super::*;’ line inside the ‘tests’ module.  The ‘tests’
module is a regular module that follows the usual visibility rules we
covered in Chapter 7 in the *note “Paths for Referring to an Item in the
Module Tree”: Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree.
section.  Because the ‘tests’ module is an inner module, we need to
bring the code under test in the outer module into the scope of the
inner module.  We use a glob here, so anything we define in the outer
module is available to this ‘tests’ module.

We've named our test ‘larger_can_hold_smaller’, and we've created the
two ‘Rectangle’ instances that we need.  Then we called the ‘assert!’
macro and passed it the result of calling ‘larger.can_hold(&smaller)’.
This expression is supposed to return ‘true’, so our test should pass.
Let's find out!

$ cargo test
   Compiling rectangle v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangle)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.66s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/rectangle-6584c4561e48942e)

running 1 test
test tests::larger_can_hold_smaller ... ok

   Doc-tests rectangle

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

It does pass!  Let's add another test, this time asserting that a
smaller rectangle cannot hold a larger rectangle:

Filename: src/lib.rs

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn larger_can_hold_smaller() {
        // --snip--
    }

    fn smaller_cannot_hold_larger() {
        let larger = Rectangle {
            width: 8,
            height: 7,
        };
        let smaller = Rectangle {
            width: 5,
            height: 1,
        };

        assert!(!smaller.can_hold(&larger));
    }
}

Because the correct result of the ‘can_hold’ function in this case is
‘false’, we need to negate that result before we pass it to the
‘assert!’ macro.  As a result, our test will pass if ‘can_hold’ returns
‘false’:

$ cargo test
   Compiling rectangle v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangle)

   Doc-tests rectangle

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Two tests that pass!  Now let's see what happens to our test results
when we introduce a bug in our code.  We'll change the implementation of
the ‘can_hold’ method by replacing the greater-than sign with a
less-than sign when it compares the widths:

// --snip--
impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width < other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

Running the tests now produces the following:

$ cargo test
   Compiling rectangle v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangle)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.66s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/rectangle-6584c4561e48942e)

    tests::larger_can_hold_smaller

test result: FAILED. 1 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

error: test failed, to rerun pass `--lib`

Our tests caught the bug!  Because ‘larger.width’ is ‘8’ and
‘smaller.width’ is ‘5’, the comparison of the widths in ‘can_hold’ now
returns ‘false’: 8 is not less than 5.

14.1.1.2 Testing Equality with the ‘assert_eq!’ and
...................................................

‘assert_ne!’ Macros A common way to verify functionality is to test for
equality between the result of the code under test and the value you
expect the code to return.  You could do this by using the ‘assert!’
macro and passing it an expression using the ‘==’ operator.  However,
this is such a common test that the standard library provides a pair of
macros--‘assert_eq!’ and ‘assert_ne!’--to perform this test more
conveniently.  These macros compare two arguments for equality or
inequality, respectively.  They'll also print the two values if the
assertion fails, which makes it easier to see ‘why’ the test failed;
conversely, the ‘assert!’ macro only indicates that it got a ‘false’
value for the ‘==’ expression, without printing the values that led to
the ‘false’ value.

In Listing 11-7, we write a function named ‘add_two’ that adds ‘2’ to
its parameter, then we test this function using the ‘assert_eq!’ macro.

pub fn add_two(a: usize) -> usize {
    a + 2
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn it_adds_two() {
        let result = add_two(2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}

Let's check that it passes!

   Doc-tests adder

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

We create a variable named ‘result’ that holds the result of calling
‘add_two(2)’.  Then we pass ‘result’ and ‘4’ as the arguments to
‘assert_eq!’.  The output line for this test is ‘test tests::it_adds_two
... ok’, and the ‘ok’ text indicates that our test passed!

Let's introduce a bug into our code to see what ‘assert_eq!’ looks like
when it fails.  Change the implementation of the ‘add_two’ function to
instead add ‘3’:

pub fn add_two(a: usize) -> usize {
    a + 3
}

Run the tests again:

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)

    tests::it_adds_two

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

error: test failed, to rerun pass `--lib`

Our test caught the bug!  The ‘it_adds_two’ test failed, and the message
tells us ‘assertion `left == right` failed’ and what the ‘left’ and
‘right’ values are.  This message helps us start debugging: the ‘left’
argument, where we had the result of calling ‘add_two(2)’, was ‘5’ but
the ‘right’ argument was ‘4’.  You can imagine that this would be
especially helpful when we have a lot of tests going on.

Note that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to
equality assertion functions are called ‘expected’ and ‘actual’, and the
order in which we specify the arguments matters.  However, in Rust,
they're called ‘left’ and ‘right’, and the order in which we specify the
value we expect and the value the code produces doesn't matter.  We
could write the assertion in this test as ‘assert_eq!(4, result)’, which
would produce the same failure message that displays ‘assertion failed:
`(left == right)`’.

The ‘assert_ne!’ macro will pass if the two values we give it are not
equal and fail if they're equal.  This macro is most useful for cases
when we're not sure what a value ‘will’ be, but we know what the value
definitely ‘shouldn't’ be.  For example, if we're testing a function
that is guaranteed to change its input in some way, but the way in which
the input is changed depends on the day of the week that we run our
tests, the best thing to assert might be that the output of the function
is not equal to the input.

Under the surface, the ‘assert_eq!’ and ‘assert_ne!’ macros use the
operators ‘==’ and ‘!=’, respectively.  When the assertions fail, these
macros print their arguments using debug formatting, which means the
values being compared must implement the ‘PartialEq’ and ‘Debug’ traits.
All primitive types and most of the standard library types implement
these traits.  For structs and enums that you define yourself, you'll
need to implement ‘PartialEq’ to assert equality of those types.  You'll
also need to implement ‘Debug’ to print the values when the assertion
fails.  Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in
Listing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as straightforward as adding
the ‘#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]’ annotation to your struct or enum
definition.  See Appendix C, *note “Derivable Traits”: Appendix C
Derivable Traits. for more details about these and other derivable
traits.

14.1.1.3 Adding Custom Failure Messages
.......................................

You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message
as optional arguments to the ‘assert!’, ‘assert_eq!’, and ‘assert_ne!’
macros.  Any arguments specified after the required arguments are passed
along to the ‘format!’ macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the *note
“Concatenation with the ‘+’ Operator or the ‘format!’ Macro”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch08-02-stringsmd__concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro.
section), so you can pass a format string that contains ‘{}’
placeholders and values to go in those placeholders.  Custom messages
are useful for documenting what an assertion means; when a test fails,
you'll have a better idea of what the problem is with the code.

For example, let's say we have a function that greets people by name and
we want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the
output:

Filename: src/lib.rs

pub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello {name}!")
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting("Carol");
        assert!(result.contains("Carol"));
    }
}

The requirements for this program haven't been agreed upon yet, and
we're pretty sure the ‘Hello’ text at the beginning of the greeting will
change.  We decided we don't want to have to update the test when the
requirements change, so instead of checking for exact equality to the
value returned from the ‘greeting’ function, we'll just assert that the
output contains the text of the input parameter.

Now let's introduce a bug into this code by changing ‘greeting’ to
exclude ‘name’ to see what the default test failure looks like:

pub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {
    String::from("Hello!")
}

Running this test produces the following:

$ cargo test

    tests::greeting_contains_name

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

error: test failed, to rerun pass `--lib`

This result just indicates that the assertion failed and which line the
assertion is on.  A more useful failure message would print the value
from the ‘greeting’ function.  Let's add a custom failure message
composed of a format string with a placeholder filled in with the actual
value we got from the ‘greeting’ function:

    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting("Carol");
        assert!(
            result.contains("Carol"),
            "Greeting did not contain name, value was `{result}`"
        );
    }

Now when we run the test, we'll get a more informative error message:

$ cargo test

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

We can see the value we actually got in the test output, which would
help us debug what happened instead of what we were expecting to happen.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Checking for Panics with should_panic,  Next: Using Result<T E> in Tests,  Prev: Adding Custom Failure Messages,  Up: How to Write Tests

14.1.1.4 Checking for Panics with ‘should_panic’
................................................

In addition to checking return values, it's important to check that our
code handles error conditions as we expect.  For example, consider the
‘Guess’ type that we created in Chapter 9, Listing 9-13.  Other code
that uses ‘Guess’ depends on the guarantee that ‘Guess’ instances will
contain only values between 1 and 100.  We can write a test that ensures
that attempting to create a ‘Guess’ instance with a value outside that
range panics.

We do this by adding the attribute ‘should_panic’ to our test function.
The test passes if the code inside the function panics; the test fails
if the code inside the function doesn't panic.

Listing 11-8 shows a test that checks that the error conditions of
‘Guess::new’ happen when we expect them to.

pub struct Guess {
    value: i32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 || value > 100 {
            panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {value}.");
        }

        Guess { value }
    }
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn greater_than_100() {
        Guess::new(200);
    }
}

We place the ‘#[should_panic]’ attribute after the ‘#[test]’ attribute
and before the test function it applies to.  Let's look at the result
when this test passes:

$ cargo test
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.58s

   Doc-tests guessing_game

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Looks good!  Now let's introduce a bug in our code by removing the
condition that the ‘new’ function will panic if the value is greater
than 100:

// --snip--
impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 {
            panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {value}.");
        }

        Guess { value }
    }
}

When we run the test in Listing 11-8, it will fail:

$ cargo test
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.62s

    tests::greater_than_100

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

error: test failed, to rerun pass `--lib`

We don't get a very helpful message in this case, but when we look at
the test function, we see that it's annotated with ‘#[should_panic]’.
The failure we got means that the code in the test function did not
cause a panic.

Tests that use ‘should_panic’ can be imprecise.  A ‘should_panic’ test
would pass even if the test panics for a different reason from the one
we were expecting.  To make ‘should_panic’ tests more precise, we can
add an optional ‘expected’ parameter to the ‘should_panic’ attribute.
The test harness will make sure that the failure message contains the
provided text.  For example, consider the modified code for ‘Guess’ in
Listing 11-9 where the ‘new’ function panics with different messages
depending on whether the value is too small or too large.

// --snip--

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 {
            panic!(
                "Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got {value}."
            );
        } else if value > 100 {
            panic!(
                "Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got {value}."
            );
        }

        Guess { value }
    }
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn greater_than_100() {
        Guess::new(200);
    }
}

This test will pass because the value we put in the ‘should_panic’
attribute's ‘expected’ parameter is a substring of the message that the
‘Guess::new’ function panics with.  We could have specified the entire
panic message that we expect, which in this case would be ‘Guess value
must be less than or equal to 100, got 200’.  What you choose to specify
depends on how much of the panic message is unique or dynamic and how
precise you want your test to be.  In this case, a substring of the
panic message is enough to ensure that the code in the test function
executes the ‘else if value > 100’ case.

To see what happens when a ‘should_panic’ test with an ‘expected’
message fails, let's again introduce a bug into our code by swapping the
bodies of the ‘if value < 1’ and the ‘else if value > 100’ blocks:

        if value < 1 {
            panic!(
                "Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got {value}."
            );
        } else if value > 100 {
            panic!(
                "Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got {value}."
            );
        }

This time when we run the ‘should_panic’ test, it will fail:

The failure message indicates that this test did indeed panic as we
expected, but the panic message did not include the expected string
‘less than or equal to 100’.  The panic message that we did get in this
case was ‘Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got 200.’ Now
we can start figuring out where our bug is!

14.1.1.5 Using ‘Result<T, E>’ in Tests
......................................

Our tests so far all panic when they fail.  We can also write tests that
use ‘Result<T, E>’!  Here's the test from Listing 11-1, rewritten to use
‘Result<T, E>’ and return an ‘Err’ instead of panicking:

    fn it_works() -> Result<(), String> {
        let result = add(2, 2);

        if result == 4 {
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))
        }
    }

The ‘it_works’ function now has the ‘Result<(), String>’ return type.
In the body of the function, rather than calling the ‘assert_eq!’ macro,
we return ‘Ok(())’ when the test passes and an ‘Err’ with a ‘String’
inside when the test fails.

Writing tests so they return a ‘Result<T, E>’ enables you to use the
question mark operator in the body of tests, which can be a convenient
way to write tests that should fail if any operation within them returns
an ‘Err’ variant.

You can't use the ‘#[should_panic]’ annotation on tests that use
‘Result<T, E>’.  To assert that an operation returns an ‘Err’ variant,
‘don't’ use the question mark operator on the ‘Result<T, E>’ value.
Instead, use ‘assert!(value.is_err())’.

Now that you know several ways to write tests, let's look at what is
happening when we run our tests and explore the different options we can
use with ‘cargo test’.

14.1.2 Controlling How Tests Are Run
------------------------------------

Just as ‘cargo run’ compiles your code and then runs the resultant
binary, ‘cargo test’ compiles your code in test mode and runs the
resultant test binary.  The default behavior of the binary produced by
‘cargo test’ is to run all the tests in parallel and capture output
generated during test runs, preventing the output from being displayed
and making it easier to read the output related to the test results.
You can, however, specify command line options to change this default
behavior.

Some command line options go to ‘cargo test’, and some go to the
resultant test binary.  To separate these two types of arguments, you
list the arguments that go to ‘cargo test’ followed by the separator
‘--’ and then the ones that go to the test binary.  Running ‘cargo test
--help’ displays the options you can use with ‘cargo test’, and running
‘cargo test -- --help’ displays the options you can use after the
separator.  Those options are also documented in the “Tests” section
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html) of the the rustc book
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html).

14.1.2.1 Running Tests in Parallel or Consecutively
...................................................

When you run multiple tests, by default they run in parallel using
threads, meaning they finish running faster and you get feedback
quicker.  Because the tests are running at the same time, you must make
sure your tests don't depend on each other or on any shared state,
including a shared environment, such as the current working directory or
environment variables.

For example, say each of your tests runs some code that creates a file
on disk named ‘test-output.txt’ and writes some data to that file.  Then
each test reads the data in that file and asserts that the file contains
a particular value, which is different in each test.  Because the tests
run at the same time, one test might overwrite the file in the time
between another test writing and reading the file.  The second test will
then fail, not because the code is incorrect but because the tests have
interfered with each other while running in parallel.  One solution is
to make sure each test writes to a different file; another solution is
to run the tests one at a time.

If you don't want to run the tests in parallel or if you want more
fine-grained control over the number of threads used, you can send the
‘--test-threads’ flag and the number of threads you want to use to the
test binary.  Take a look at the following example:

$ cargo test -- --test-threads=1

We set the number of test threads to ‘1’, telling the program not to use
any parallelism.  Running the tests using one thread will take longer
than running them in parallel, but the tests won't interfere with each
other if they share state.

14.1.2.2 Showing Function Output
................................

By default, if a test passes, Rust's test library captures anything
printed to standard output.  For example, if we call ‘println!’ in a
test and the test passes, we won't see the ‘println!’ output in the
terminal; we'll see only the line that indicates the test passed.  If a
test fails, we'll see whatever was printed to standard output with the
rest of the failure message.

As an example, Listing 11-10 has a silly function that prints the value
of its parameter and returns 10, as well as a test that passes and a
test that fails.

fn prints_and_returns_10(a: i32) -> i32 {
    println!("I got the value {a}");
    10
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn this_test_will_pass() {
        let value = prints_and_returns_10(4);
        assert_eq!(value, 10);
    }

    fn this_test_will_fail() {
        let value = prints_and_returns_10(8);
        assert_eq!(value, 5);
    }
}

When we run these tests with ‘cargo test’, we'll see the following
output:

$ cargo test

Note that nowhere in this output do we see ‘I got the value 4’, which is
printed when the test that passes runs.  That output has been captured.
The output from the test that failed, ‘I got the value 8’, appears in
the section of the test summary output, which also shows the cause of
the test failure.

If we want to see printed values for passing tests as well, we can tell
Rust to also show the output of successful tests with ‘--show-output’:

$ cargo test -- --show-output

When we run the tests in Listing 11-10 again with the ‘--show-output’
flag, we see the following output:

14.1.2.3 Running a Subset of Tests by Name
..........................................

Sometimes, running a full test suite can take a long time.  If you're
working on code in a particular area, you might want to run only the
tests pertaining to that code.  You can choose which tests to run by
passing ‘cargo test’ the name or names of the test(s) you want to run as
an argument.

To demonstrate how to run a subset of tests, we'll first create three
tests for our ‘add_two’ function, as shown in Listing 11-11, and choose
which ones to run.

pub fn add_two(a: usize) -> usize {
    a + 2
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn add_two_and_two() {
        let result = add_two(2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }

    fn add_three_and_two() {
        let result = add_two(3);
        assert_eq!(result, 5);
    }

    fn one_hundred() {
        let result = add_two(100);
        assert_eq!(result, 102);
    }
}

If we run the tests without passing any arguments, as we saw earlier,
all the tests will run in parallel:

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.62s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

running 3 tests
test tests::add_three_and_two ... ok
test tests::add_two_and_two ... ok
test tests::one_hundred ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Running Single Tests We can pass the name of any test function to ‘cargo
test’ to run only that test:

$ cargo test one_hundred
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.69s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

running 1 test
test tests::one_hundred ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 2 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Only the test with the name ‘one_hundred’ ran; the other two tests
didn't match that name.  The test output lets us know we had more tests
that didn't run by displaying ‘2 filtered out’ at the end.

We can't specify the names of multiple tests in this way; only the first
value given to ‘cargo test’ will be used.  But there is a way to run
multiple tests.  Filtering to Run Multiple Tests We can specify part of
a test name, and any test whose name matches that value will be run.
For example, because two of our tests' names contain ‘add’, we can run
those two by running ‘cargo test add’:

$ cargo test add
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

running 2 tests
test tests::add_three_and_two ... ok
test tests::add_two_and_two ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 1 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

This command ran all tests with ‘add’ in the name and filtered out the
test named ‘one_hundred’.  Also note that the module in which a test
appears becomes part of the test's name, so we can run all the tests in
a module by filtering on the module's name.

14.1.2.4 Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically Requested
..........................................................

Sometimes a few specific tests can be very time-consuming to execute, so
you might want to exclude them during most runs of ‘cargo test’.  Rather
than listing as arguments all tests you do want to run, you can instead
annotate the time-consuming tests using the ‘ignore’ attribute to
exclude them, as shown here:

Filename: src/lib.rs

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }

    fn expensive_test() {
        // code that takes an hour to run
    }
}

After ‘#[test]’, we add the ‘#[ignore]’ line to the test we want to
exclude.  Now when we run our tests, ‘it_works’ runs, but
‘expensive_test’ doesn't:

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.60s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

running 2 tests
test tests::expensive_test ... ignored
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

The ‘expensive_test’ function is listed as ‘ignored’.  If we want to run
only the ignored tests, we can use ‘cargo test -- --ignored’:

$ cargo test -- --ignored
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

running 1 test
test expensive_test ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 1 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

By controlling which tests run, you can make sure your ‘cargo test’
results will be returned quickly.  When you're at a point where it makes
sense to check the results of the ‘ignored’ tests and you have time to
wait for the results, you can run ‘cargo test -- --ignored’ instead.  If
you want to run all tests whether they're ignored or not, you can run
‘cargo test -- --include-ignored’.

14.1.3 Test Organization
------------------------

As mentioned at the start of the chapter, testing is a complex
discipline, and different people use different terminology and
organization.  The Rust community thinks about tests in terms of two
main categories: unit tests and integration tests.  ‘Unit tests’ are
small and more focused, testing one module in isolation at a time, and
can test private interfaces.  ‘Integration tests’ are entirely external
to your library and use your code in the same way any other external
code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising
multiple modules per test.

Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of
your library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.

* Menu:

* Unit Tests::
* Integration Tests::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Unit Tests,  Next: Integration Tests,  Prev: Test Organization,  Up: Test Organization

14.1.3.1 Unit Tests
...................

The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from
the rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn't working
as expected.  You'll put unit tests in the ‘src’ directory in each file
with the code that they're testing.  The convention is to create a
module named ‘tests’ in each file to contain the test functions and to
annotate the module with ‘cfg(test)’.  The Tests Module and
‘#[cfg(test)]’ The ‘#[cfg(test)]’ annotation on the ‘tests’ module tells
Rust to compile and run the test code only when you run ‘cargo test’,
not when you run ‘cargo build’.  This saves compile time when you only
want to build the library and saves space in the resultant compiled
artifact because the tests are not included.  You'll see that because
integration tests go in a different directory, they don't need the
‘#[cfg(test)]’ annotation.  However, because unit tests go in the same
files as the code, you'll use ‘#[cfg(test)]’ to specify that they
shouldn't be included in the compiled result.

Recall that when we generated the new ‘adder’ project in the first
section of this chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:

Filename: src/lib.rs

pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -> u64 {
    left + right
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}

On the automatically generated ‘tests’ module, the attribute ‘cfg’
stands for ‘configuration’ and tells Rust that the following item should
only be included given a certain configuration option.  In this case,
the configuration option is ‘test’, which is provided by Rust for
compiling and running tests.  By using the ‘cfg’ attribute, Cargo
compiles our test code only if we actively run the tests with ‘cargo
test’.  This includes any helper functions that might be within this
module, in addition to the functions annotated with ‘#[test]’.  Testing
Private Functions There's debate within the testing community about
whether or not private functions should be tested directly, and other
languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions.
Regardless of which testing ideology you adhere to, Rust's privacy rules
do allow you to test private functions.  Consider the code in Listing
11-12 with the private function ‘internal_adder’.

pub fn add_two(a: usize) -> usize {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn internal() {
        let result = internal_adder(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}

Note that the ‘internal_adder’ function is not marked as ‘pub’.  Tests
are just Rust code, and the ‘tests’ module is just another module.  As
we discussed in the *note “Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module
Tree”: Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree. section, items
in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules.  In this
test, we bring all of the ‘tests’ module's parent's items into scope
with ‘use super::*’, and then the test can call ‘internal_adder’.  If
you don't think private functions should be tested, there's nothing in
Rust that will compel you to do so.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Integration Tests,  Next: Summary 11,  Prev: Unit Tests,  Up: Test Organization

14.1.3.2 Integration Tests
..........................

In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library.  They
use your library in the same way any other code would, which means they
can only call functions that are part of your library's public API.
Their purpose is to test whether many parts of your library work
together correctly.  Units of code that work correctly on their own
could have problems when integrated, so test coverage of the integrated
code is important as well.  To create integration tests, you first need
a ‘tests’ directory.  The ‘tests’ Directory We create a ‘tests’
directory at the top level of our project directory, next to ‘src’.
Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory.  We
can then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each
of the files as an individual crate.

Let's create an integration test.  With the code in Listing 11-12 still
in the ‘src/lib.rs’ file, make a ‘tests’ directory, and create a new
file named ‘tests/integration_test.rs’.  Your directory structure should
look like this:

adder
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── integration_test.rs

Enter the code in Listing 11-13 into the ‘tests/integration_test.rs’
file.

use adder::add_two;

fn it_adds_two() {
    let result = add_two(2);
    assert_eq!(result, 4);
}

Each file in the ‘tests’ directory is a separate crate, so we need to
bring our library into each test crate's scope.  For that reason we add
‘use adder::add_two;’ at the top of the code, which we didn't need in
the unit tests.

We don't need to annotate any code in ‘tests/integration_test.rs’ with
‘#[cfg(test)]’.  Cargo treats the ‘tests’ directory specially and
compiles files in this directory only when we run ‘cargo test’.  Run
‘cargo test’ now:

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.31s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-1082c4b063a8fbe6)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration
test, and the doc tests.  Note that if any test in a section fails, the
following sections will not be run.  For example, if a unit test fails,
there won't be any output for integration and doc tests because those
tests will only be run if all unit tests are passing.

The first section for the unit tests is the same as we've been seeing:
one line for each unit test (one named ‘internal’ that we added in
Listing 11-12) and then a summary line for the unit tests.

The integration tests section starts with the line ‘Running
tests/integration_test.rs’.  Next, there is a line for each test
function in that integration test and a summary line for the results of
the integration test just before the ‘Doc-tests adder’ section starts.

Each integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files
in the ‘tests’ directory, there will be more integration test sections.

We can still run a particular integration test function by specifying
the test function's name as an argument to ‘cargo test’.  To run all the
tests in a particular integration test file, use the ‘--test’ argument
of ‘cargo test’ followed by the name of the file:

$ cargo test --test integration_test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.64s
     Running tests/integration_test.rs (target/debug/deps/integration_test-82e7799c1bc62298)

running 1 test
test it_adds_two ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

This command runs only the tests in the ‘tests/integration_test.rs’
file.  Submodules in Integration Tests As you add more integration
tests, you might want to make more files in the ‘tests’ directory to
help organize them; for example, you can group the test functions by the
functionality they're testing.  As mentioned earlier, each file in the
‘tests’ directory is compiled as its own separate crate, which is useful
for creating separate scopes to more closely imitate the way end users
will be using your crate.  However, this means files in the ‘tests’
directory don't share the same behavior as files in ‘src’ do, as you
learned in Chapter 7 regarding how to separate code into modules and
files.

The different behavior of ‘tests’ directory files is most noticeable
when you have a set of helper functions to use in multiple integration
test files and you try to follow the steps in the *note “Separating
Modules into Different Files”: Separating Modules into Different Files.
section of Chapter 7 to extract them into a common module.  For example,
if we create ‘tests/common.rs’ and place a function named ‘setup’ in it,
we can add some code to ‘setup’ that we want to call from multiple test
functions in multiple test files:

Filename: tests/common.rs

pub fn setup() {
    // setup code specific to your library's tests would go here
}

When we run the tests again, we'll see a new section in the test output
for the ‘common.rs’ file, even though this file doesn't contain any test
functions nor did we call the ‘setup’ function from anywhere:

$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.89s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-92948b65e88960b4)

running 1 test
test tests::internal ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

     Running tests/common.rs (target/debug/deps/common-92948b65e88960b4)

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

     Running tests/integration_test.rs (target/debug/deps/integration_test-92948b65e88960b4)

running 1 test
test it_adds_two ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Having ‘common’ appear in the test results with ‘running 0 tests’
displayed for it is not what we wanted.  We just wanted to share some
code with the other integration test files.  To avoid having ‘common’
appear in the test output, instead of creating ‘tests/common.rs’, we'll
create ‘tests/common/mod.rs’.  The project directory now looks like
this:

├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    ├── common
    │   └── mod.rs
    └── integration_test.rs

This is the older naming convention that Rust also understands that we
mentioned in the *note “Alternate File Paths”: Alternate File Paths.
section of Chapter 7.  Naming the file this way tells Rust not to treat
the ‘common’ module as an integration test file.  When we move the
‘setup’ function code into ‘tests/common/mod.rs’ and delete the
‘tests/common.rs’ file, the section in the test output will no longer
appear.  Files in subdirectories of the ‘tests’ directory don't get
compiled as separate crates or have sections in the test output.

After we've created ‘tests/common/mod.rs’, we can use it from any of the
integration test files as a module.  Here's an example of calling the
‘setup’ function from the ‘it_adds_two’ test in
‘tests/integration_test.rs’:

Filename: tests/integration_test.rs

use adder::add_two;

mod common;

fn it_adds_two() {
    common::setup();

    let result = add_two(2);
    assert_eq!(result, 4);
}

Note that the ‘mod common;’ declaration is the same as the module
declaration we demonstrated in Listing 7-21.  Then, in the test
function, we can call the ‘common::setup()’ function.  Integration Tests
for Binary Crates If our project is a binary crate that only contains a
‘src/main.rs’ file and doesn't have a ‘src/lib.rs’ file, we can't create
integration tests in the ‘tests’ directory and bring functions defined
in the ‘src/main.rs’ file into scope with a ‘use’ statement.  Only
library crates expose functions that other crates can use; binary crates
are meant to be run on their own.

This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a
straightforward ‘src/main.rs’ file that calls logic that lives in the
‘src/lib.rs’ file.  Using that structure, integration tests ‘can’ test
the library crate with ‘use’ to make the important functionality
available.  If the important functionality works, the small amount of
code in the ‘src/main.rs’ file will work as well, and that small amount
of code doesn't need to be tested.

14.1.4 Summary
--------------

Rust's testing features provide a way to specify how code should
function to ensure it continues to work as you expect, even as you make
changes.  Unit tests exercise different parts of a library separately
and can test private implementation details.  Integration tests check
that many parts of the library work together correctly, and they use the
library's public API to test the code in the same way external code will
use it.  Even though Rust's type system and ownership rules help prevent
some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to reduce logic bugs
having to do with how your code is expected to behave.

Let's combine the knowledge you learned in this chapter and in previous
chapters to work on a project!

15 An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program
**************************************************

This chapter is a recap of the many skills you've learned so far and an
exploration of a few more standard library features.  We'll build a
command line tool that interacts with file and command line input/output
to practice some of the Rust concepts you now have under your belt.

Rust's speed, safety, single binary output, and cross-platform support
make it an ideal language for creating command line tools, so for our
project, we'll make our own version of the classic command line search
tool ‘grep’ (*g*lobally search a *r*egular *e*xpression and *p*rint).
In the simplest use case, ‘grep’ searches a specified file for a
specified string.  To do so, ‘grep’ takes as its arguments a file path
and a string.  Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that
contain the string argument, and prints those lines.

Along the way, we'll show how to make our command line tool use the
terminal features that many other command line tools use.  We'll read
the value of an environment variable to allow the user to configure the
behavior of our tool.  We'll also print error messages to the standard
error console stream (‘stderr’) instead of standard output (‘stdout’) so
that, for example, the user can redirect successful output to a file
while still seeing error messages onscreen.

One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully
featured, very fast version of ‘grep’, called ‘ripgrep’.  By comparison,
our version will be fairly simple, but this chapter will give you some
of the background knowledge you need to understand a real-world project
such as ‘ripgrep’.

Our ‘grep’ project will combine a number of concepts you've learned so
far:

   • Organizing code (*note Chapter 7: Managing Growing Projects with
     Packages Crates and Modules.)
   • Using vectors and strings (*note Chapter 8: Common Collections.)
   • Handling errors (*note Chapter 9: Error Handling.)
   • Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (*note Chapter 10:
     Generic Types Traits and Lifetimes.)
   • Writing tests (*note Chapter 11: Writing Automated Tests.)

We'll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects,
which *note Chapter 13: Functional Language Features Iterators and
Closures. and *note Chapter 18: Object-Oriented Programming Features of
Rust. will cover in detail.

15.1 Accepting Command Line Arguments
=====================================

Let's create a new project with, as always, ‘cargo new’.  We'll call our
project ‘minigrep’ to distinguish it from the ‘grep’ tool that you might
already have on your system.

$ cargo new minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep

The first task is to make ‘minigrep’ accept its two command line
arguments: the file path and a string to search for.  That is, we want
to be able to run our program with ‘cargo run’, two hyphens to indicate
the following arguments are for our program rather than for ‘cargo’, a
string to search for, and a path to a file to search in, like so:

$ cargo run -- searchstring example-filename.txt

Right now, the program generated by ‘cargo new’ cannot process arguments
we give it.  Some existing libraries on cratesio (https://crates.io/)
can help with writing a program that accepts command line arguments, but
because you're just learning this concept, let's implement this
capability ourselves.

* Saving the Argument Values in Variables::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Reading the Argument Values,  Next: The args Function and Invalid Unicode,  Prev: Accepting Command Line Arguments,  Up: Accepting Command Line Arguments

15.1.1 Reading the Argument Values
----------------------------------

To enable ‘minigrep’ to read the values of command line arguments we
pass to it, we'll need the ‘std::env::args’ function provided in Rust's
standard library.  This function returns an iterator of the command line
arguments passed to ‘minigrep’.  We'll cover iterators fully in *note
Chapter 13: Functional Language Features Iterators and Closures.  For
now, you only need to know two details about iterators: iterators
produce a series of values, and we can call the ‘collect’ method on an
iterator to turn it into a collection, such as a vector, that contains
all the elements the iterator produces.

The code in Listing 12-1 allows your ‘minigrep’ program to read any
command line arguments passed to it, and then collect the values into a
vector.

use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    dbg!(args);
}

First we bring the ‘std::env’ module into scope with a ‘use’ statement
so we can use its ‘args’ function.  Notice that the ‘std::env::args’
function is nested in two levels of modules.  As we discussed in *note
Chapter 7: Creating Idiomatic use Paths, in cases where the desired
function is nested in more than one module, we've chosen to bring the
parent module into scope rather than the function.  By doing so, we can
easily use other functions from ‘std::env’.  It's also less ambiguous
than adding ‘use std::env::args’ and then calling the function with just
‘args’, because ‘args’ might easily be mistaken for a function that's
defined in the current module.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: The args Function and Invalid Unicode,  Next: Saving the Argument Values in Variables,  Prev: Reading the Argument Values,  Up: Accepting Command Line Arguments

15.1.1.1 The ‘args’ Function and Invalid Unicode
................................................

Note that ‘std::env::args’ will panic if any argument contains invalid
Unicode.  If your program needs to accept arguments containing invalid
Unicode, use ‘std::env::args_os’ instead.  That function returns an
iterator that produces ‘OsString’ values instead of ‘String’ values.
We've chosen to use ‘std::env::args’ here for simplicity because
‘OsString’ values differ per platform and are more complex to work with
than ‘String’ values.

On the first line of ‘main’, we call ‘env::args’, and we immediately use
‘collect’ to turn the iterator into a vector containing all the values
produced by the iterator.  We can use the ‘collect’ function to create
many kinds of collections, so we explicitly annotate the type of ‘args’
to specify that we want a vector of strings.  Although you very rarely
need to annotate types in Rust, ‘collect’ is one function you do often
need to annotate because Rust isn't able to infer the kind of collection
you want.

Finally, we print the vector using the debug macro.  Let's try running
the code first with no arguments and then with two arguments:

$ cargo run
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
[src/main.rs:5:5] args = [
    "target/debug/minigrep",
]

$ cargo run -- needle haystack
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.57s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep needle haystack`
[src/main.rs:5:5] args = [
    "target/debug/minigrep",
    "needle",
    "haystack",
]

Notice that the first value in the vector is ‘"target/debug/minigrep"’,
which is the name of our binary.  This matches the behavior of the
arguments list in C, letting programs use the name by which they were
invoked in their execution.  It's often convenient to have access to the
program name in case you want to print it in messages or change the
behavior of the program based on what command line alias was used to
invoke the program.  But for the purposes of this chapter, we'll ignore
it and save only the two arguments we need.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Saving the Argument Values in Variables,  Next: Reading a File,  Prev: The args Function and Invalid Unicode,  Up: Accepting Command Line Arguments

15.1.1.2 Saving the Argument Values in Variables
................................................

The program is currently able to access the values specified as command
line arguments.  Now we need to save the values of the two arguments in
variables so we can use the values throughout the rest of the program.
We do that in Listing 12-2.

use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let query = &args[1];
    let file_path = &args[2];

    println!("Searching for {query}");
    println!("In file {file_path}");
}

As we saw when we printed the vector, the program's name takes up the
first value in the vector at ‘args[0]’, so we're starting arguments at
index 1.  The first argument ‘minigrep’ takes is the string we're
searching for, so we put a reference to the first argument in the
variable ‘query’.  The second argument will be the file path, so we put
a reference to the second argument in the variable ‘file_path’.

We temporarily print the values of these variables to prove that the
code is working as we intend.  Let's run this program again with the
arguments ‘test’ and ‘sample.txt’:

$ cargo run -- test sample.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep test sample.txt`
Searching for test
In file sample.txt

Great, the program is working!  The values of the arguments we need are
being saved into the right variables.  Later we'll add some error
handling to deal with certain potential erroneous situations, such as
when the user provides no arguments; for now, we'll ignore that
situation and work on adding file-reading capabilities instead.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Reading a File,  Next: Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling,  Prev: Accepting Command Line Arguments,  Up: An I/O Project Building a Command Line Program

15.1.2 Reading a File
---------------------

Now we'll add functionality to read the file specified in the
‘file_path’ argument.  First we need a sample file to test it with:
we'll use a file with a small amount of text over multiple lines with
some repeated words.  Listing 12-3 has an Emily Dickinson poem that will
work well!  Create a file called ‘poem.txt’ at the root level of your
project, and enter the poem “I'm Nobody!  Who are you?”

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

With the text in place, edit ‘src/main.rs’ and add code to read the
file, as shown in Listing 12-4.

use std::env;
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
    println!("In file {file_path}");

    let contents = fs::read_to_string(file_path)
        .expect("Should have been able to read the file");

    println!("With text:\n{contents}");
}

First we bring in a relevant part of the standard library with a ‘use’
statement: we need ‘std::fs’ to handle files.

In ‘main’, the new statement ‘fs::read_to_string’ takes the ‘file_path’,
opens that file, and returns a value of type ‘std::io::Result<String>’
that contains the file's contents.

After that, we again add a temporary ‘println!’ statement that prints
the value of ‘contents’ after the file is read, so we can check that the
program is working so far.

Let's run this code with any string as the first command line argument
(because we haven't implemented the searching part yet) and the
‘poem.txt’ file as the second argument:

$ cargo run -- the poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep the poem.txt`
Searching for the
In file poem.txt
With text:
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

Great!  The code read and then printed the contents of the file.  But
the code has a few flaws.  At the moment, the ‘main’ function has
multiple responsibilities: generally, functions are clearer and easier
to maintain if each function is responsible for only one idea.  The
other problem is that we're not handling errors as well as we could.
The program is still small, so these flaws aren't a big problem, but as
the program grows, it will be harder to fix them cleanly.  It's a good
practice to begin refactoring early on when developing a program because
it's much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code.  We'll do that
next.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling,  Next: Developing the Library's Functionality with Test-Driven Development,  Prev: Reading a File,  Up: An I/O Project Building a Command Line Program

15.1.3 Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling
-----------------------------------------------------------

To improve our program, we'll fix four problems that have to do with the
program's structure and how it's handling potential errors.  First, our
‘main’ function now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and reads
files.  As our program grows, the number of separate tasks the ‘main’
function handles will increase.  As a function gains responsibilities,
it becomes more difficult to reason about, harder to test, and harder to
change without breaking one of its parts.  It's best to separate
functionality so each function is responsible for one task.

This issue also ties into the second problem: although ‘query’ and
‘file_path’ are configuration variables to our program, variables like
‘contents’ are used to perform the program's logic.  The longer ‘main’
becomes, the more variables we'll need to bring into scope; the more
variables we have in scope, the harder it will be to keep track of the
purpose of each.  It's best to group the configuration variables into
one structure to make their purpose clear.

The third problem is that we've used ‘expect’ to print an error message
when reading the file fails, but the error message just prints ‘Should
have been able to read the file’.  Reading a file can fail in a number
of ways: for example, the file could be missing, or we might not have
permission to open it.  Right now, regardless of the situation, we'd
print the same error message for everything, which wouldn't give the
user any information!

Fourth, we use ‘expect’ to handle an error, and if the user runs our
program without specifying enough arguments, they'll get an ‘index out
of bounds’ error from Rust that doesn't clearly explain the problem.  It
would be best if all the error-handling code were in one place so future
maintainers had only one place to consult the code if the error-handling
logic needed to change.  Having all the error-handling code in one place
will also ensure that we're printing messages that will be meaningful to
our end users.

Let's address these four problems by refactoring our project.

15.1.3.1 Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects
...................................................

The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple
tasks to the ‘main’ function is common to many binary projects.  As a
result, the Rust community has developed guidelines for splitting the
separate concerns of a binary program when ‘main’ starts getting large.
This process has the following steps:

   • Split your program into a ‘main.rs’ file and a ‘lib.rs’ file and
     move your program's logic to ‘lib.rs’.
   • As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain
     in ‘main.rs’.
   • When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated,
     extract it from ‘main.rs’ and move it to ‘lib.rs’.

The responsibilities that remain in the ‘main’ function after this
process should be limited to the following:

   • Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
   • Setting up any other configuration
   • Calling a ‘run’ function in ‘lib.rs’
   • Handling the error if ‘run’ returns an error

This pattern is about separating concerns: ‘main.rs’ handles running the
program and ‘lib.rs’ handles all the logic of the task at hand.  Because
you can't test the ‘main’ function directly, this structure lets you
test all of your program's logic by moving it into functions in
‘lib.rs’.  The code that remains in ‘main.rs’ will be small enough to
verify its correctness by reading it.  Let's rework our program by
following this process.  Extracting the Argument Parser We'll extract
the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that ‘main’ will
call to prepare for moving the command line parsing logic to
‘src/lib.rs’.  Listing 12-5 shows the new start of ‘main’ that calls a
new function ‘parse_config’, which we'll define in ‘src/main.rs’ for the
moment.

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let (query, file_path) = parse_config(&args);

    // --snip--
}

fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> (&str, &str) {
    let query = &args[1];
    let file_path = &args[2];

    (query, file_path)
}

We're still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but
instead of assigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable
‘query’ and the argument value at index 2 to the variable ‘file_path’
within the ‘main’ function, we pass the whole vector to the
‘parse_config’ function.  The ‘parse_config’ function then holds the
logic that determines which argument goes in which variable and passes
the values back to ‘main’.  We still create the ‘query’ and ‘file_path’
variables in ‘main’, but ‘main’ no longer has the responsibility of
determining how the command line arguments and variables correspond.

This rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we're
refactoring in small, incremental steps.  After making this change, run
the program again to verify that the argument parsing still works.  It's
good to check your progress often, to help identify the cause of
problems when they occur.  Grouping Configuration Values We can take
another small step to improve the ‘parse_config’ function further.  At
the moment, we're returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that
tuple into individual parts again.  This is a sign that perhaps we don't
have the right abstraction yet.

Another indicator that shows there's room for improvement is the
‘config’ part of ‘parse_config’, which implies that the two values we
return are related and are both part of one configuration value.  We're
not currently conveying this meaning in the structure of the data other
than by grouping the two values into a tuple; we'll instead put the two
values into one struct and give each of the struct fields a meaningful
name.  Doing so will make it easier for future maintainers of this code
to understand how the different values relate to each other and what
their purpose is.

Listing 12-6 shows the improvements to the ‘parse_config’ function.

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = parse_config(&args);

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.file_path);

    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)
        .expect("Should have been able to read the file");

    // --snip--
}

struct Config {
    query: String,
    file_path: String,
}

fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> Config {
    let query = args[1].clone();
    let file_path = args[2].clone();

    Config { query, file_path }
}

We've added a struct named ‘Config’ defined to have fields named ‘query’
and ‘file_path’.  The signature of ‘parse_config’ now indicates that it
returns a ‘Config’ value.  In the body of ‘parse_config’, where we used
to return string slices that reference ‘String’ values in ‘args’, we now
define ‘Config’ to contain owned ‘String’ values.  The ‘args’ variable
in ‘main’ is the owner of the argument values and is only letting the
‘parse_config’ function borrow them, which means we'd violate Rust's
borrowing rules if ‘Config’ tried to take ownership of the values in
‘args’.

There are a number of ways we could manage the ‘String’ data; the
easiest, though somewhat inefficient, route is to call the ‘clone’
method on the values.  This will make a full copy of the data for the
‘Config’ instance to own, which takes more time and memory than storing
a reference to the string data.  However, cloning the data also makes
our code very straightforward because we don't have to manage the
lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance, giving up a little
performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.

15.1.3.2 The Trade-Offs of Using ‘clone’
........................................

There's a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using ‘clone’ to fix
ownership problems because of its runtime cost.  In *note Chapter 13:
Functional Language Features Iterators and Closures, you'll learn how to
use more efficient methods in this type of situation.  But for now, it's
okay to copy a few strings to continue making progress because you'll
make these copies only once and your file path and query string are very
small.  It's better to have a working program that's a bit inefficient
than to try to hyperoptimize code on your first pass.  As you become
more experienced with Rust, it'll be easier to start with the most
efficient solution, but for now, it's perfectly acceptable to call
‘clone’.

We've updated ‘main’ so it places the instance of ‘Config’ returned by
‘parse_config’ into a variable named ‘config’, and we updated the code
that previously used the separate ‘query’ and ‘file_path’ variables so
it now uses the fields on the ‘Config’ struct instead.

Now our code more clearly conveys that ‘query’ and ‘file_path’ are
related and that their purpose is to configure how the program will
work.  Any code that uses these values knows to find them in the
‘config’ instance in the fields named for their purpose.  Creating a
Constructor for ‘Config’ So far, we've extracted the logic responsible
for parsing the command line arguments from ‘main’ and placed it in the
‘parse_config’ function.  Doing so helped us see that the ‘query’ and
‘file_path’ values were related, and that relationship should be
conveyed in our code.  We then added a ‘Config’ struct to name the
related purpose of ‘query’ and ‘file_path’ and to be able to return the
values' names as struct field names from the ‘parse_config’ function.

So now that the purpose of the ‘parse_config’ function is to create a
‘Config’ instance, we can change ‘parse_config’ from a plain function to
a function named ‘new’ that is associated with the ‘Config’ struct.
Making this change will make the code more idiomatic.  We can create
instances of types in the standard library, such as ‘String’, by calling
‘String::new’.  Similarly, by changing ‘parse_config’ into a ‘new’
function associated with ‘Config’, we'll be able to create instances of
‘Config’ by calling ‘Config::new’.  Listing 12-7 shows the changes we
need to make.

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&args);

    // --snip--
}

// --snip--

impl Config {
    fn new(args: &[String]) -> Config {
        let query = args[1].clone();
        let file_path = args[2].clone();

        Config { query, file_path }
    }
}

We've updated ‘main’ where we were calling ‘parse_config’ to instead
call ‘Config::new’.  We've changed the name of ‘parse_config’ to ‘new’
and moved it within an ‘impl’ block, which associates the ‘new’ function
with ‘Config’.  Try compiling this code again to make sure it works.

15.1.3.3 Fixing the Error Handling
..................................

Now we'll work on fixing our error handling.  Recall that attempting to
access the values in the ‘args’ vector at index 1 or index 2 will cause
the program to panic if the vector contains fewer than three items.  Try
running the program without any arguments; it will look like this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:27:21:
index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

The line ‘index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1’ is an
error message intended for programmers.  It won't help our end users
understand what they should do instead.  Let's fix that now.  Improving
the Error Message In Listing 12-8, we add a check in the ‘new’ function
that will verify that the slice is long enough before accessing index 1
and index 2.  If the slice isn't long enough, the program panics and
displays a better error message.

    // --snip--
    fn new(args: &[String]) -> Config {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            panic!("not enough arguments");
        }
        // --snip--

This code is similar to *note the ‘Guessnew’ function we wrote in
Listing 9-13: Creating Custom Types for Validation, where we called
‘panic!’ when the ‘value’ argument was out of the range of valid values.
Instead of checking for a range of values here, we're checking that the
length of ‘args’ is at least ‘3’ and the rest of the function can
operate under the assumption that this condition has been met.  If
‘args’ has fewer than three items, this condition will be ‘true’, and we
call the ‘panic!’ macro to end the program immediately.

With these extra few lines of code in ‘new’, let's run the program
without any arguments again to see what the error looks like now:

$ cargo run
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:26:13:
not enough arguments
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

This output is better: we now have a reasonable error message.  However,
we also have extraneous information we don't want to give to our users.
Perhaps the technique we used in Listing 9-13 isn't the best one to use
here: a call to ‘panic!’ is more appropriate for a programming problem
than a usage problem, *note as discussed in Chapter 9: Guidelines for
Error Handling.  Instead, we'll use the other technique you learned
about in Chapter 9--*note returning a ‘Result’: Recoverable Errors with
Result. that indicates either success or an error.  Returning a ‘Result’
Instead of Calling ‘panic!’ We can instead return a ‘Result’ value that
will contain a ‘Config’ instance in the successful case and will
describe the problem in the error case.  We're also going to change the
function name from ‘new’ to ‘build’ because many programmers expect
‘new’ functions to never fail.  When ‘Config::build’ is communicating to
‘main’, we can use the ‘Result’ type to signal there was a problem.
Then we can change ‘main’ to convert an ‘Err’ variant into a more
practical error for our users without the surrounding text about ‘thread
'main'’ and ‘RUST_BACKTRACE’ that a call to ‘panic!’ causes.

Listing 12-9 shows the changes we need to make to the return value of
the function we're now calling ‘Config::build’ and the body of the
function needed to return a ‘Result’.  Note that this won't compile
until we update ‘main’ as well, which we'll do in the next listing.

impl Config {
    fn build(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let file_path = args[2].clone();

        Ok(Config { query, file_path })
    }
}

Our ‘build’ function returns a ‘Result’ with a ‘Config’ instance in the
success case and a string literal in the error case.  Our error values
will always be string literals that have the ‘'static’ lifetime.

We've made two changes in the body of the function: instead of calling
‘panic!’ when the user doesn't pass enough arguments, we now return an
‘Err’ value, and we've wrapped the ‘Config’ return value in an ‘Ok’.
These changes make the function conform to its new type signature.

Returning an ‘Err’ value from ‘Config::build’ allows the ‘main’ function
to handle the ‘Result’ value returned from the ‘build’ function and exit
the process more cleanly in the error case.  Calling ‘Config::build’ and
Handling Errors To handle the error case and print a user-friendly
message, we need to update ‘main’ to handle the ‘Result’ being returned
by ‘Config::build’, as shown in Listing 12-10.  We'll also take the
responsibility of exiting the command line tool with a nonzero error
code away from ‘panic!’ and instead implement it by hand.  A nonzero
exit status is a convention to signal to the process that called our
program that the program exited with an error state.

use std::process;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::build(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        println!("Problem parsing arguments: {err}");
        process::exit(1);
    });

    // --snip--

In this listing, we've used a method we haven't covered in detail yet:
‘unwrap_or_else’, which is defined on ‘Result<T, E>’ by the standard
library.  Using ‘unwrap_or_else’ allows us to define some custom,
non-‘panic!’ error handling.  If the ‘Result’ is an ‘Ok’ value, this
method's behavior is similar to ‘unwrap’: it returns the inner value
that ‘Ok’ is wrapping.  However, if the value is an ‘Err’ value, this
method calls the code in the ‘closure’, which is an anonymous function
we define and pass as an argument to ‘unwrap_or_else’.  We'll cover
closures in more detail in *note Chapter 13: Functional Language
Features Iterators and Closures.  For now, you just need to know that
‘unwrap_or_else’ will pass the inner value of the ‘Err’, which in this
case is the static string ‘"not enough arguments"’ that we added in
Listing 12-9, to our closure in the argument ‘err’ that appears between
the vertical pipes.  The code in the closure can then use the ‘err’
value when it runs.

We've added a new ‘use’ line to bring ‘process’ from the standard
library into scope.  The code in the closure that will be run in the
error case is only two lines: we print the ‘err’ value and then call
‘process::exit’.  The ‘process::exit’ function will stop the program
immediately and return the number that was passed as the exit status
code.  This is similar to the ‘panic!’-based handling we used in Listing
12-8, but we no longer get all the extra output.  Let's try it:

$ cargo run
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments

Great!  This output is much friendlier for our users.

15.1.3.4 Extracting Logic from ‘main’
.....................................

Now that we've finished refactoring the configuration parsing, let's
turn to the program's logic.  As we stated in *note “Separation of
Concerns for Binary Projects”: Separation of Concerns for Binary
Projects, we'll extract a function named ‘run’ that will hold all the
logic currently in the ‘main’ function that isn't involved with setting
up configuration or handling errors.  When we're done, ‘main’ will be
concise and easy to verify by inspection, and we'll be able to write
tests for all the other logic.

Listing 12-11 shows the extracted ‘run’ function.  For now, we're just
making the small, incremental improvement of extracting the function.
We're still defining the function in ‘src/main.rs’.

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.file_path);

    run(config);
}

fn run(config: Config) {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)
        .expect("Should have been able to read the file");

    println!("With text:\n{contents}");
}

// --snip--

The ‘run’ function now contains all the remaining logic from ‘main’,
starting from reading the file.  The ‘run’ function takes the ‘Config’
instance as an argument.  Returning Errors from the ‘run’ Function With
the remaining program logic separated into the ‘run’ function, we can
improve the error handling, as we did with ‘Config::build’ in Listing
12-9.  Instead of allowing the program to panic by calling ‘expect’, the
‘run’ function will return a ‘Result<T, E>’ when something goes wrong.
This will let us further consolidate the logic around handling errors
into ‘main’ in a user-friendly way.  Listing 12-12 shows the changes we
need to make to the signature and body of ‘run’.

use std::error::Error;

// --snip--

fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)?;

    println!("With text:\n{contents}");

    Ok(())
}

We've made three significant changes here.  First, we changed the return
type of the ‘run’ function to ‘Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>’.  This
function previously returned the unit type, ‘()’, and we keep that as
the value returned in the ‘Ok’ case.

For the error type, we used the ‘trait object’ ‘Box<dyn Error>’ (and
we've brought ‘std::error::Error’ into scope with a ‘use’ statement at
the top).  We'll cover trait objects in *note Chapter 18:
Object-Oriented Programming Features of Rust.  For now, just know that
‘Box<dyn Error>’ means the function will return a type that implements
the ‘Error’ trait, but we don't have to specify what particular type the
return value will be.  This gives us flexibility to return error values
that may be of different types in different error cases.  The ‘dyn’
keyword is short for ‘dynamic’.

Second, we've removed the call to ‘expect’ in favor of the ‘?’ operator,
as we talked about in *note Chapter 9:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-resultmd__a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator.
Rather than ‘panic!’ on an error, ‘?’ will return the error value from
the current function for the caller to handle.

Third, the ‘run’ function now returns an ‘Ok’ value in the success case.
We've declared the ‘run’ function's success type as ‘()’ in the
signature, which means we need to wrap the unit type value in the ‘Ok’
value.  This ‘Ok(())’ syntax might look a bit strange at first, but
using ‘()’ like this is the idiomatic way to indicate that we're calling
‘run’ for its side effects only; it doesn't return a value we need.

When you run this code, it will compile but will display a warning:

Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!

To an admiring bog!

Rust tells us that our code ignored the ‘Result’ value and the ‘Result’
value might indicate that an error occurred.  But we're not checking to
see whether or not there was an error, and the compiler reminds us that
we probably meant to have some error-handling code here!  Let's rectify
that problem now.  Handling Errors Returned from ‘run’ in ‘main’ We'll
check for errors and handle them using a technique similar to one we
used with ‘Config::build’ in Listing 12-10, but with a slight
difference:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.file_path);

    if let Err(e) = run(config) {
        println!("Application error: {e}");
        process::exit(1);
    }
}

We use ‘if let’ rather than ‘unwrap_or_else’ to check whether ‘run’
returns an ‘Err’ value and to call ‘process::exit(1)’ if it does.  The
‘run’ function doesn't return a value that we want to ‘unwrap’ in the
same way that ‘Config::build’ returns the ‘Config’ instance.  Because
‘run’ returns ‘()’ in the success case, we only care about detecting an
error, so we don't need ‘unwrap_or_else’ to return the unwrapped value,
which would only be ‘()’.

The bodies of the ‘if let’ and the ‘unwrap_or_else’ functions are the
same in both cases: we print the error and exit.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Splitting Code into a Library Crate,  Next: Developing the Library's Functionality with Test-Driven Development,  Prev: Extracting Logic from main,  Up: Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling

15.1.3.5 Splitting Code into a Library Crate
............................................

Our ‘minigrep’ project is looking good so far!  Now we'll split the
‘src/main.rs’ file and put some code into the ‘src/lib.rs’ file.  That
way, we can test the code and have a ‘src/main.rs’ file with fewer
responsibilities.

Let's move all the code that isn't in the ‘main’ function from
‘src/main.rs’ to ‘src/lib.rs’:

   • The ‘run’ function definition
   • The relevant ‘use’ statements
   • The definition of ‘Config’
   • The ‘Config::build’ function definition

The contents of ‘src/lib.rs’ should have the signatures shown in Listing
12-13 (we've omitted the bodies of the functions for brevity).  Note
that this won't compile until we modify ‘src/main.rs’ in Listing 12-14.

use std::error::Error;
use std::fs;

pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub file_path: String,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn build(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        // --snip--
    }
}

pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // --snip--
}

We've made liberal use of the ‘pub’ keyword: on ‘Config’, on its fields
and its ‘build’ method, and on the ‘run’ function.  We now have a
library crate that has a public API we can test!

Now we need to bring the code we moved to ‘src/lib.rs’ into the scope of
the binary crate in ‘src/main.rs’, as shown in Listing 12-14.

use std::env;
use std::process;

use minigrep::Config;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        // --snip--
    }
}

We add a ‘use minigrep::Config’ line to bring the ‘Config’ type from the
library crate into the binary crate's scope, and we prefix the ‘run’
function with our crate name.  Now all the functionality should be
connected and should work.  Run the program with ‘cargo run’ and make
sure everything works correctly.

Whew!  That was a lot of work, but we've set ourselves up for success in
the future.  Now it's much easier to handle errors, and we've made the
code more modular.  Almost all of our work will be done in ‘src/lib.rs’
from here on out.

Let's take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that
would have been difficult with the old code but is easy with the new
code: we'll write some tests!

15.1.4 Developing the Library's Functionality with Test-Driven
--------------------------------------------------------------

Development Now that we've extracted the logic into ‘src/lib.rs’ and
left the argument collecting and error handling in ‘src/main.rs’, it's
much easier to write tests for the core functionality of our code.  We
can call functions directly with various arguments and check return
values without having to call our binary from the command line.

In this section, we'll add the searching logic to the ‘minigrep’ program
using the test-driven development (TDD) process with the following
steps:

  1. Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the
     reason you expect.
  2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
  3. Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests
     continue to pass.
  4. Repeat from step 1!

Though it's just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive
code design.  Writing the test before you write the code that makes the
test pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.

We'll test-drive the implementation of the functionality that will
actually do the searching for the query string in the file contents and
produce a list of lines that match the query.  We'll add this
functionality in a function called ‘search’.

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Writing a Failing Test,  Next: Writing Code to Pass the Test,  Prev: Developing the Library's Functionality with Test-Driven Development,  Up: Developing the Library's Functionality with Test-Driven Development

15.1.4.1 Writing a Failing Test
...............................

Because we don't need them anymore, let's remove the ‘println!’
statements from ‘src/lib.rs’ and ‘src/main.rs’ that we used to check the
program's behavior.  Then, in ‘src/lib.rs’, we'll add a ‘tests’ module
with a test function, as we did in *note Chapter 11: The Anatomy of a
Test Function.  The test function specifies the behavior we want the
‘search’ function to have: it will take a query and the text to search,
and it will return only the lines from the text that contain the query.
Listing 12-15 shows this test, which won't compile yet.

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn one_result() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.";

        assert_eq!(vec!["safe, fast, productive."], search(query, contents));
    }
}

This test searches for the string ‘"duct"’.  The text we're searching is
three lines, only one of which contains ‘"duct"’ (note that the
backslash after the opening double quote tells Rust not to put a newline
character at the beginning of the contents of this string literal).  We
assert that the value returned from the ‘search’ function contains only
the line we expect.

We aren't yet able to run this test and watch it fail because the test
doesn't even compile: the ‘search’ function doesn't exist yet!  In
accordance with TDD principles, we'll add just enough code to get the
test to compile and run by adding a definition of the ‘search’ function
that always returns an empty vector, as shown in Listing 12-16.  Then
the test should compile and fail because an empty vector doesn't match a
vector containing the line ‘"safe, fast, productive."’

pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    vec![]
}

Notice that we need to define an explicit lifetime ‘'a’ in the signature
of ‘search’ and use that lifetime with the ‘contents’ argument and the
return value.  Recall in *note Chapter 10: Validating References with
Lifetimes. that the lifetime parameters specify which argument lifetime
is connected to the lifetime of the return value.  In this case, we
indicate that the returned vector should contain string slices that
reference slices of the argument ‘contents’ (rather than the argument
‘query’).

In other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the ‘search’
function will live as long as the data passed into the ‘search’ function
in the ‘contents’ argument.  This is important!  The data referenced
‘by’ a slice needs to be valid for the reference to be valid; if the
compiler assumes we're making string slices of ‘query’ rather than
‘contents’, it will do its safety checking incorrectly.

If we forget the lifetime annotations and try to compile this function,
we'll get this error:

$ cargo build

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0106`.
error: could not compile `minigrep` (lib) due to 1 previous error

Rust can't possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need
to tell it explicitly.  Because ‘contents’ is the argument that contains
all of our text and we want to return the parts of that text that match,
we know ‘contents’ is the argument that should be connected to the
return value using the lifetime syntax.

Other programming languages don't require you to connect arguments to
return values in the signature, but this practice will get easier over
time.  You might want to compare this example with the examples in the
*note “Validating References with Lifetimes”: Validating References with
Lifetimes. section in Chapter 10.

Now let's run the test:

15.1.4.2 Writing Code to Pass the Test
......................................

Currently, our test is failing because we always return an empty vector.
To fix that and implement ‘search’, our program needs to follow these
steps:

  1. Iterate through each line of the contents.
  2. Check whether the line contains our query string.
  3. If it does, add it to the list of values we're returning.
  4. If it doesn't, do nothing.
  5. Return the list of results that match.

Let's work through each step, starting with iterating through lines.
Iterating Through Lines with the ‘lines’ Method Rust has a helpful
method to handle line-by-line iteration of strings, conveniently named
‘lines’, that works as shown in Listing 12-17.  Note that this won't
compile yet.

pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        // do something with line
    }
}

The ‘lines’ method returns an iterator.  We'll talk about iterators in
depth in *note Chapter 13: Processing a Series of Items with Iterators,
but recall that you saw this way of using an iterator in *note Listing
3-5:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch03-05-control-flowmd__looping-through-a-collection-with-for,
where we used a ‘for’ loop with an iterator to run some code on each
item in a collection.  Searching Each Line for the Query Next, we'll
check whether the current line contains our query string.  Fortunately,
strings have a helpful method named ‘contains’ that does this for us!
Add a call to the ‘contains’ method in the ‘search’ function, as shown
in Listing 12-18.  Note that this still won't compile yet.

pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            // do something with line
        }
    }
}

At the moment, we're building up functionality.  To get the code to
compile, we need to return a value from the body as we indicated we
would in the function signature.  Storing Matching Lines To finish this
function, we need a way to store the matching lines that we want to
return.  For that, we can make a mutable vector before the ‘for’ loop
and call the ‘push’ method to store a ‘line’ in the vector.  After the
‘for’ loop, we return the vector, as shown in Listing 12-19.

pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}

Now the ‘search’ function should return only the lines that contain
‘query’, and our test should pass.  Let's run the test:

$ cargo test
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.22s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/minigrep-9cd200e5fac0fc94)

running 1 test
test tests::one_result ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/debug/deps/minigrep-9cd200e5fac0fc94)

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests minigrep

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Our test passed, so we know it works!

At this point, we could consider opportunities for refactoring the
implementation of the search function while keeping the tests passing to
maintain the same functionality.  The code in the search function isn't
too bad, but it doesn't take advantage of some useful features of
iterators.  We'll return to this example in *note Chapter 13: Processing
a Series of Items with Iterators, where we'll explore iterators in
detail, and look at how to improve it.  Using the ‘search’ Function in
the ‘run’ Function Now that the ‘search’ function is working and tested,
we need to call ‘search’ from our ‘run’ function.  We need to pass the
‘config.query’ value and the ‘contents’ that ‘run’ reads from the file
to the ‘search’ function.  Then ‘run’ will print each line returned from
‘search’:

Filename: src/lib.rs

pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)?;

    for line in search(&config.query, &contents) {
        println!("{line}");
    }

    Ok(())
}

We're still using a ‘for’ loop to return each line from ‘search’ and
print it.

Now the entire program should work!  Let's try it out, first with a word
that should return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem:
‘frog’.

$ cargo run -- frog poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep frog poem.txt`
How public, like a frog

Cool!  Now let's try a word that will match multiple lines, like ‘body’:

$ cargo run -- body poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep body poem.txt`
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!

And finally, let's make sure that we don't get any lines when we search
for a word that isn't anywhere in the poem, such as ‘monomorphization’:

$ cargo run -- monomorphization poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep monomorphization poem.txt`

Excellent!  We've built our own mini version of a classic tool and
learned a lot about how to structure applications.  We've also learned a
bit about file input and output, lifetimes, testing, and command line
parsing.

To round out this project, we'll briefly demonstrate how to work with
environment variables and how to print to standard error, both of which
are useful when you're writing command line programs.

15.1.5 Working with Environment Variables
-----------------------------------------

We'll improve ‘minigrep’ by adding an extra feature: an option for
case-insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment
variable.  We could make this feature a command line option and require
that users enter it each time they want it to apply, but by instead
making it an environment variable, we allow our users to set the
environment variable once and have all their searches be case
insensitive in that terminal session.

15.1.5.1 Writing a Failing Test for the Case-Insensitive
........................................................

‘search’ Function We first add a new ‘search_case_insensitive’ function
that will be called when the environment variable has a value.  We'll
continue to follow the TDD process, so the first step is again to write
a failing test.  We'll add a new test for the new
‘search_case_insensitive’ function and rename our old test from
‘one_result’ to ‘case_sensitive’ to clarify the differences between the
two tests, as shown in Listing 12-20.

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn case_sensitive() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Duct tape.";

        assert_eq!(vec!["safe, fast, productive."], search(query, contents));
    }

    fn case_insensitive() {
        let query = "rUsT";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Trust me.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["Rust:", "Trust me."],
            search_case_insensitive(query, contents)
        );
    }
}

Note that we've edited the old test's ‘contents’ too.  We've added a new
line with the text ‘"Duct tape."’ using a capital ‘D’ that shouldn't
match the query ‘"duct"’ when we're searching in a case-sensitive
manner.  Changing the old test in this way helps ensure that we don't
accidentally break the case-sensitive search functionality that we've
already implemented.  This test should pass now and should continue to
pass as we work on the case-insensitive search.

The new test for the case-‘insensitive’ search uses ‘"rUsT"’ as its
query.  In the ‘search_case_insensitive’ function we're about to add,
the query ‘"rUsT"’ should match the line containing ‘"Rust:"’ with a
capital ‘R’ and match the line ‘"Trust me."’ even though both have
different casing from the query.  This is our failing test, and it will
fail to compile because we haven't yet defined the
‘search_case_insensitive’ function.  Feel free to add a skeleton
implementation that always returns an empty vector, similar to the way
we did for the ‘search’ function in Listing 12-16 to see the test
compile and fail.

15.1.5.2 Implementing the ‘search_case_insensitive’ Function
............................................................

The ‘search_case_insensitive’ function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be
almost the same as the ‘search’ function.  The only difference is that
we'll lowercase the ‘query’ and each ‘line’ so that whatever the case of
the input arguments, they'll be the same case when we check whether the
line contains the query.

pub fn search_case_insensitive<'a>(
    query: &str,
    contents: &'a str,
) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let query = query.to_lowercase();
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.to_lowercase().contains(&query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}

First we lowercase the ‘query’ string and store it in a new variable
with the same name, shadowing the original.  Calling ‘to_lowercase’ on
the query is necessary so that no matter whether the user's query is
‘"rust"’, ‘"RUST"’, ‘"Rust"’, or ‘"rUsT"’, we'll treat the query as if
it were ‘"rust"’ and be insensitive to the case.  While ‘to_lowercase’
will handle basic Unicode, it won't be 100% accurate.  If we were
writing a real application, we'd want to do a bit more work here, but
this section is about environment variables, not Unicode, so we'll leave
it at that here.

Note that ‘query’ is now a ‘String’ rather than a string slice because
calling ‘to_lowercase’ creates new data rather than referencing existing
data.  Say the query is ‘"rUsT"’, as an example: that string slice
doesn't contain a lowercase ‘u’ or ‘t’ for us to use, so we have to
allocate a new ‘String’ containing ‘"rust"’.  When we pass ‘query’ as an
argument to the ‘contains’ method now, we need to add an ampersand
because the signature of ‘contains’ is defined to take a string slice.

Next, we add a call to ‘to_lowercase’ on each ‘line’ to lowercase all
characters.  Now that we've converted ‘line’ and ‘query’ to lowercase,
we'll find matches no matter what the case of the query is.

Let's see if this implementation passes the tests:

$ cargo test
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.33s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/minigrep-9cd200e5fac0fc94)

test tests::case_sensitive ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests minigrep

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Great!  They passed.  Now, let's call the new ‘search_case_insensitive’
function from the ‘run’ function.  First we'll add a configuration
option to the ‘Config’ struct to switch between case-sensitive and
case-insensitive search.  Adding this field will cause compiler errors
because we aren't initializing this field anywhere yet:

Filename: src/lib.rs

pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub file_path: String,
    pub ignore_case: bool,
}

We added the ‘ignore_case’ field that holds a Boolean.  Next, we need
the ‘run’ function to check the ‘ignore_case’ field's value and use that
to decide whether to call the ‘search’ function or the
‘search_case_insensitive’ function, as shown in Listing 12-22.  This
still won't compile yet.

pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)?;

    let results = if config.ignore_case {
        search_case_insensitive(&config.query, &contents)
    } else {
        search(&config.query, &contents)
    };

    for line in results {
        println!("{line}");
    }

    Ok(())
}

Finally, we need to check for the environment variable.  The functions
for working with environment variables are in the ‘env’ module in the
standard library, so we bring that module into scope at the top of
‘src/lib.rs’.  Then we'll use the ‘var’ function from the ‘env’ module
to check to see if any value has been set for an environment variable
named ‘IGNORE_CASE’, as shown in Listing 12-23.

use std::env;
// --snip--

impl Config {
    pub fn build(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let file_path = args[2].clone();

        let ignore_case = env::var("IGNORE_CASE").is_ok();

        Ok(Config {
            query,
            file_path,
            ignore_case,
        })
    }
}

Here, we create a new variable, ‘ignore_case’.  To set its value, we
call the ‘env::var’ function and pass it the name of the ‘IGNORE_CASE’
environment variable.  The ‘env::var’ function returns a ‘Result’ that
will be the successful ‘Ok’ variant that contains the value of the
environment variable if the environment variable is set to any value.
It will return the ‘Err’ variant if the environment variable is not set.

We're using the ‘is_ok’ method on the ‘Result’ to check whether the
environment variable is set, which means the program should do a
case-insensitive search.  If the ‘IGNORE_CASE’ environment variable
isn't set to anything, ‘is_ok’ will return ‘false’ and the program will
perform a case-sensitive search.  We don't care about the ‘value’ of the
environment variable, just whether it's set or unset, so we're checking
‘is_ok’ rather than using ‘unwrap’, ‘expect’, or any of the other
methods we've seen on ‘Result’.

We pass the value in the ‘ignore_case’ variable to the ‘Config’ instance
so the ‘run’ function can read that value and decide whether to call
‘search_case_insensitive’ or ‘search’, as we implemented in Listing
12-22.

Let's give it a try!  First we'll run our program without the
environment variable set and with the query ‘to’, which should match any
line that contains the word ‘to’ in all lowercase:

$ cargo run -- to poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!

Looks like that still works!  Now let's run the program with
‘IGNORE_CASE’ set to ‘1’ but with the same query ‘to’:

$ IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- to poem.txt

If you're using PowerShell, you will need to set the environment
variable and run the program as separate commands:

PS> $Env:IGNORE_CASE=1; cargo run -- to poem.txt

This will make ‘IGNORE_CASE’ persist for the remainder of your shell
session.  It can be unset with the ‘Remove-Item’ cmdlet:

PS> Remove-Item Env:IGNORE_CASE

We should get lines that contain ‘to’ that might have uppercase letters:

Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

Excellent, we also got lines containing ‘To’!  Our ‘minigrep’ program
can now do case-insensitive searching controlled by an environment
variable.  Now you know how to manage options set using either command
line arguments or environment variables.

Some programs allow arguments ‘and’ environment variables for the same
configuration.  In those cases, the programs decide that one or the
other takes precedence.  For another exercise on your own, try
controlling case sensitivity through either a command line argument or
an environment variable.  Decide whether the command line argument or
the environment variable should take precedence if the program is run
with one set to case sensitive and one set to ignore case.

The ‘std::env’ module contains many more useful features for dealing
with environment variables: check out its documentation to see what is
available.

15.1.6 Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Output At the moment, we're writing all of our output to the terminal
using the ‘println!’ macro.  In most terminals, there are two kinds of
output: ‘standard output’ (‘stdout’) for general information and
‘standard error’ (‘stderr’) for error messages.  This distinction
enables users to choose to direct the successful output of a program to
a file but still print error messages to the screen.

The ‘println!’ macro is only capable of printing to standard output, so
we have to use something else to print to standard error.

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Checking Where Errors Are Written,  Next: Printing Errors to Standard Error,  Prev: Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output,  Up: Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output

15.1.6.1 Checking Where Errors Are Written
..........................................

First let's observe how the content printed by ‘minigrep’ is currently
being written to standard output, including any error messages we want
to write to standard error instead.  We'll do that by redirecting the
standard output stream to a file while intentionally causing an error.
We won't redirect the standard error stream, so any content sent to
standard error will continue to display on the screen.

Command line programs are expected to send error messages to the
standard error stream so we can still see error messages on the screen
even if we redirect the standard output stream to a file.  Our program
is not currently well behaved: we're about to see that it saves the
error message output to a file instead!

To demonstrate this behavior, we'll run the program with ‘>’ and the
file path, ‘output.txt’, that we want to redirect the standard output
stream to.  We won't pass any arguments, which should cause an error:

$ cargo run > output.txt

The ‘>’ syntax tells the shell to write the contents of standard output
to ‘output.txt’ instead of the screen.  We didn't see the error message
we were expecting printed to the screen, so that means it must have
ended up in the file.  This is what ‘output.txt’ contains:

Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments

Yup, our error message is being printed to standard output.  It's much
more useful for error messages like this to be printed to standard error
so only data from a successful run ends up in the file.  We'll change
that.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Printing Errors to Standard Error,  Next: Summary 12,  Prev: Checking Where Errors Are Written,  Up: Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output

15.1.6.2 Printing Errors to Standard Error
..........................................

We'll use the code in Listing 12-24 to change how error messages are
printed.  Because of the refactoring we did earlier in this chapter, all
the code that prints error messages is in one function, ‘main’.  The
standard library provides the ‘eprintln!’ macro that prints to the
standard error stream, so let's change the two places we were calling
‘println!’ to print errors to use ‘eprintln!’ instead.

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::build(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!("Problem parsing arguments: {err}");
        process::exit(1);
    });

    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        eprintln!("Application error: {e}");
        process::exit(1);
    }
}

Let's now run the program again in the same way, without any arguments
and redirecting standard output with ‘>’:

$ cargo run > output.txt
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments

Now we see the error onscreen and ‘output.txt’ contains nothing, which
is the behavior we expect of command line programs.

Let's run the program again with arguments that don't cause an error but
still redirect standard output to a file, like so:

$ cargo run -- to poem.txt > output.txt

We won't see any output to the terminal, and ‘output.txt’ will contain
our results:

Filename: output.txt

Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!

This demonstrates that we're now using standard output for successful
output and standard error for error output as appropriate.

15.1.7 Summary
--------------

This chapter recapped some of the major concepts you've learned so far
and covered how to perform common I/O operations in Rust.  By using
command line arguments, files, environment variables, and the
‘eprintln!’ macro for printing errors, you're now prepared to write
command line applications.  Combined with the concepts in previous
chapters, your code will be well organized, store data effectively in
the appropriate data structures, handle errors nicely, and be well
tested.

Next, we'll explore some Rust features that were influenced by
functional languages: closures and iterators.

16 Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures
*******************************************************

Rust's design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and
techniques, and one significant influence is ‘functional programming’.
Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as
values by passing them in arguments, returning them from other
functions, assigning them to variables for later execution, and so
forth.

In this chapter, we won't debate the issue of what functional
programming is or isn't but will instead discuss some features of Rust
that are similar to features in many languages often referred to as
functional.

More specifically, we'll cover:

   • ‘Closures’, a function-like construct you can store in a variable
   • ‘Iterators’, a way of processing a series of elements
   • How to use closures and iterators to improve the I/O project in
     Chapter 12
   • The performance of closures and iterators (Spoiler alert: they're
     faster than you might think!)

We've already covered some other Rust features, such as pattern matching
and enums, that are also influenced by the functional style.  Because
mastering closures and iterators is an important part of writing
idiomatic, fast Rust code, we'll devote this entire chapter to them.

16.1 Closures: Anonymous Functions that Capture Their Environment
=================================================================

Rust's closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or
pass as arguments to other functions.  You can create the closure in one
place and then call the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different
context.  Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope
in which they're defined.  We'll demonstrate how these closure features
allow for code reuse and behavior customization.

16.1.1 Capturing the Environment with Closures
----------------------------------------------

We'll first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the
environment they're defined in for later use.  Here's the scenario:
Every so often, our t-shirt company gives away an exclusive,
limited-edition shirt to someone on our mailing list as a promotion.
People on the mailing list can optionally add their favorite color to
their profile.  If the person chosen for a free shirt has their favorite
color set, they get that color shirt.  If the person hasn't specified a
favorite color, they get whatever color the company currently has the
most of.

There are many ways to implement this.  For this example, we're going to
use an enum called ‘ShirtColor’ that has the variants ‘Red’ and ‘Blue’
(limiting the number of colors available for simplicity).  We represent
the company's inventory with an ‘Inventory’ struct that has a field
named ‘shirts’ that contains a ‘Vec<ShirtColor>’ representing the shirt
colors currently in stock.  The method ‘giveaway’ defined on ‘Inventory’
gets the optional shirt color preference of the free shirt winner, and
returns the shirt color the person will get.  This setup is shown in
Listing 13-1:

enum ShirtColor {
    Red,
    Blue,
}

struct Inventory {
    shirts: Vec<ShirtColor>,
}

impl Inventory {
    fn giveaway(&self, user_preference: Option<ShirtColor>) -> ShirtColor {
        user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())
    }

    fn most_stocked(&self) -> ShirtColor {
        let mut num_red = 0;
        let mut num_blue = 0;

        for color in &self.shirts {
            match color {
                ShirtColor::Red => num_red += 1,
                ShirtColor::Blue => num_blue += 1,
            }
        }
        if num_red > num_blue {
            ShirtColor::Red
        } else {
            ShirtColor::Blue
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let store = Inventory {
        shirts: vec![ShirtColor::Blue, ShirtColor::Red, ShirtColor::Blue],
    };

    let user_pref1 = Some(ShirtColor::Red);
    let giveaway1 = store.giveaway(user_pref1);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref1, giveaway1
    );

    let user_pref2 = None;
    let giveaway2 = store.giveaway(user_pref2);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref2, giveaway2
    );
}

The ‘store’ defined in ‘main’ has two blue shirts and one red shirt
remaining to distribute for this limited-edition promotion.  We call the
‘giveaway’ method for a user with a preference for a red shirt and a
user without any preference.

Again, this code could be implemented in many ways, and here, to focus
on closures, we've stuck to concepts you've already learned except for
the body of the ‘giveaway’ method that uses a closure.  In the
‘giveaway’ method, we get the user preference as a parameter of type
‘Option<ShirtColor>’ and call the ‘unwrap_or_else’ method on
‘user_preference’.  The ‘unwrap_or_else’ method on ‘Option<T>’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/option/enum.Option.html) is
defined by the standard library.  It takes one argument: a closure
without any arguments that returns a value ‘T’ (the same type stored in
the ‘Some’ variant of the ‘Option<T>’, in this case ‘ShirtColor’).  If
the ‘Option<T>’ is the ‘Some’ variant, ‘unwrap_or_else’ returns the
value from within the ‘Some’.  If the ‘Option<T>’ is the ‘None’ variant,
‘unwrap_or_else’ calls the closure and returns the value returned by the
closure.

We specify the closure expression ‘|| self.most_stocked()’ as the
argument to ‘unwrap_or_else’.  This is a closure that takes no
parameters itself (if the closure had parameters, they would appear
between the two vertical bars).  The body of the closure calls
‘self.most_stocked()’.  We're defining the closure here, and the
implementation of ‘unwrap_or_else’ will evaluate the closure later if
the result is needed.

Running this code prints:

$ cargo run
   Compiling shirt-company v0.1.0 (file:///projects/shirt-company)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s
     Running `target/debug/shirt-company`
The user with preference Some(Red) gets Red
The user with preference None gets Blue

One interesting aspect here is that we've passed a closure that calls
‘self.most_stocked()’ on the current ‘Inventory’ instance.  The standard
library didn't need to know anything about the ‘Inventory’ or
‘ShirtColor’ types we defined, or the logic we want to use in this
scenario.  The closure captures an immutable reference to the ‘self’
‘Inventory’ instance and passes it with the code we specify to the
‘unwrap_or_else’ method.  Functions, on the other hand, are not able to
capture their environment in this way.

16.1.1.1 Closure Type Inference and Annotation
..............................................

There are more differences between functions and closures.  Closures
don't usually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the
return value like ‘fn’ functions do.  Type annotations are required on
functions because the types are part of an explicit interface exposed to
your users.  Defining this interface rigidly is important for ensuring
that everyone agrees on what types of values a function uses and
returns.  Closures, on the other hand, aren't used in an exposed
interface like this: they're stored in variables and used without naming
them and exposing them to users of our library.

Closures are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context
rather than in any arbitrary scenario.  Within these limited contexts,
the compiler can infer the types of the parameters and the return type,
similar to how it's able to infer the types of most variables (there are
rare cases where the compiler needs closure type annotations too).

As with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase
explicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is
strictly necessary.  Annotating the types for a closure would look like
the definition shown in Listing 13-2.  In this example, we're defining a
closure and storing it in a variable rather than defining the closure in
the spot we pass it as an argument as we did in Listing 13-1.

    let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    };

With type annotations added, the syntax of closures looks more similar
to the syntax of functions.  Here we define a function that adds 1 to
its parameter and a closure that has the same behavior, for comparison.
We've added some spaces to line up the relevant parts.  This illustrates
how closure syntax is similar to function syntax except for the use of
pipes and the amount of syntax that is optional:

fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;

The first line shows a function definition, and the second line shows a
fully annotated closure definition.  In the third line, we remove the
type annotations from the closure definition.  In the fourth line, we
remove the brackets, which are optional because the closure body has
only one expression.  These are all valid definitions that will produce
the same behavior when they're called.  The ‘add_one_v3’ and
‘add_one_v4’ lines require the closures to be evaluated to be able to
compile because the types will be inferred from their usage.  This is
similar to ‘let v = Vec::new();’ needing either type annotations or
values of some type to be inserted into the ‘Vec’ for Rust to be able to
infer the type.

For closure definitions, the compiler will infer one concrete type for
each of their parameters and for their return value.  For instance,
Listing 13-3 shows the definition of a short closure that just returns
the value it receives as a parameter.  This closure isn't very useful
except for the purposes of this example.  Note that we haven't added any
type annotations to the definition.  Because there are no type
annotations, we can call the closure with any type, which we've done
here with ‘String’ the first time.  If we then try to call
‘example_closure’ with an integer, we'll get an error.

    let example_closure = |x| x;

    let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
    let n = example_closure(5);

The compiler gives us this error:

$ cargo run

The first time we call ‘example_closure’ with the ‘String’ value, the
compiler infers the type of ‘x’ and the return type of the closure to be
‘String’.  Those types are then locked into the closure in
‘example_closure’, and we get a type error when we next try to use a
different type with the same closure.

16.1.1.2 Capturing References or Moving Ownership
.................................................

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which
directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter:
borrowing immutably, borrowing mutably, and taking ownership.  The
closure will decide which of these to use based on what the body of the
function does with the captured values.

In Listing 13-4, we define a closure that captures an immutable
reference to the vector named ‘list’ because it only needs an immutable
reference to print the value:

fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {list:?}");

    let only_borrows = || println!("From closure: {list:?}");

    println!("Before calling closure: {list:?}");
    only_borrows();
    println!("After calling closure: {list:?}");
}

This example also illustrates that a variable can bind to a closure
definition, and we can later call the closure by using the variable name
and parentheses as if the variable name were a function name.

Because we can have multiple immutable references to ‘list’ at the same
time, ‘list’ is still accessible from the code before the closure
definition, after the closure definition but before the closure is
called, and after the closure is called.  This code compiles, runs, and
prints:

$ cargo run

From closure: [1, 2, 3]
After calling closure: [1, 2, 3]

Next, in Listing 13-5, we change the closure body so that it adds an
element to the ‘list’ vector.  The closure now captures a mutable
reference:

fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {list:?}");

    let mut borrows_mutably = || list.push(7);

    borrows_mutably();
    println!("After calling closure: {list:?}");
}

This code compiles, runs, and prints:

     Running `target/debug/closure-example`
Before defining closure: [1, 2, 3]
After calling closure: [1, 2, 3, 7]

Note that there's no longer a ‘println!’ between the definition and the
call of the ‘borrows_mutably’ closure: when ‘borrows_mutably’ is
defined, it captures a mutable reference to ‘list’.  We don't use the
closure again after the closure is called, so the mutable borrow ends.
Between the closure definition and the closure call, an immutable borrow
to print isn't allowed because no other borrows are allowed when there's
a mutable borrow.  Try adding a ‘println!’ there to see what error
message you get!

If you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses
in the environment even though the body of the closure doesn't strictly
need ownership, you can use the ‘move’ keyword before the parameter
list.

This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread
to move the data so that it's owned by the new thread.  We'll discuss
threads and why you would want to use them in detail in Chapter 16 when
we talk about concurrency, but for now, let's briefly explore spawning a
new thread using a closure that needs the ‘move’ keyword.  Listing 13-6
shows Listing 13-4 modified to print the vector in a new thread rather
than in the main thread:

use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {list:?}");

    thread::spawn(move || println!("From thread: {list:?}"))
        .join()
        .unwrap();
}

We spawn a new thread, giving the thread a closure to run as an
argument.  The closure body prints out the list.  In Listing 13-4, the
closure only captured ‘list’ using an immutable reference because that's
the least amount of access to ‘list’ needed to print it.  In this
example, even though the closure body still only needs an immutable
reference, we need to specify that ‘list’ should be moved into the
closure by putting the ‘move’ keyword at the beginning of the closure
definition.  The new thread might finish before the rest of the main
thread finishes, or the main thread might finish first.  If the main
thread maintained ownership of ‘list’ but ended before the new thread
did and dropped ‘list’, the immutable reference in the thread would be
invalid.  Therefore, the compiler requires that ‘list’ be moved into the
closure given to the new thread so the reference will be valid.  Try
removing the ‘move’ keyword or using ‘list’ in the main thread after the
closure is defined to see what compiler errors you get!

16.1.1.3 Moving Captured Values Out of Closures and the ‘Fn’
............................................................

Traits Once a closure has captured a reference or captured ownership of
a value from the environment where the closure is defined (thus
affecting what, if anything, is moved ‘into’ the closure), the code in
the body of the closure defines what happens to the references or values
when the closure is evaluated later (thus affecting what, if anything,
is moved ‘out of’ the closure).  A closure body can do any of the
following: move a captured value out of the closure, mutate the captured
value, neither move nor mutate the value, or capture nothing from the
environment to begin with.

The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment
affects which traits the closure implements, and traits are how
functions and structs can specify what kinds of closures they can use.
Closures will automatically implement one, two, or all three of these
‘Fn’ traits, in an additive fashion, depending on how the closure's body
handles the values:

  1. ‘FnOnce’ applies to closures that can be called once.  All closures
     implement at least this trait, because all closures can be called.
     A closure that moves captured values out of its body will only
     implement ‘FnOnce’ and none of the other ‘Fn’ traits, because it
     can only be called once.
  2. ‘FnMut’ applies to closures that don't move captured values out of
     their body, but that might mutate the captured values.  These
     closures can be called more than once.
  3. ‘Fn’ applies to closures that don't move captured values out of
     their body and that don't mutate captured values, as well as
     closures that capture nothing from their environment.  These
     closures can be called more than once without mutating their
     environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure
     multiple times concurrently.

Let's look at the definition of the ‘unwrap_or_else’ method on
‘Option<T>’ that we used in Listing 13-1:

impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn unwrap_or_else<F>(self, f: F) -> T
    where
        F: FnOnce() -> T
    {
        match self {
            Some(x) => x,
            None => f(),
        }
    }
}

Recall that ‘T’ is the generic type representing the type of the value
in the ‘Some’ variant of an ‘Option’.  That type ‘T’ is also the return
type of the ‘unwrap_or_else’ function: code that calls ‘unwrap_or_else’
on an ‘Option<String>’, for example, will get a ‘String’.

Next, notice that the ‘unwrap_or_else’ function has the additional
generic type parameter ‘F’.  The ‘F’ type is the type of the parameter
named ‘f’, which is the closure we provide when calling
‘unwrap_or_else’.

The trait bound specified on the generic type ‘F’ is ‘FnOnce() -> T’,
which means ‘F’ must be able to be called once, take no arguments, and
return a ‘T’.  Using ‘FnOnce’ in the trait bound expresses the
constraint that ‘unwrap_or_else’ is only going to call ‘f’ at most one
time.  In the body of ‘unwrap_or_else’, we can see that if the ‘Option’
is ‘Some’, ‘f’ won't be called.  If the ‘Option’ is ‘None’, ‘f’ will be
called once.  Because all closures implement ‘FnOnce’, ‘unwrap_or_else’
accepts all three kinds of closures and is as flexible as it can be.

Note: Functions can implement all three of the ‘Fn’ traits too.  If what
we want to do doesn't require capturing a value from the environment, we
can use the name of a function rather than a closure where we need
something that implements one of the ‘Fn’ traits.  For example, on an
‘Option<Vec<T>>’ value, we could call ‘unwrap_or_else(Vec::new)’ to get
a new, empty vector if the value is ‘None’.

Now let's look at the standard library method ‘sort_by_key’ defined on
slices, to see how that differs from ‘unwrap_or_else’ and why
‘sort_by_key’ uses ‘FnMut’ instead of ‘FnOnce’ for the trait bound.  The
closure gets one argument in the form of a reference to the current item
in the slice being considered, and returns a value of type ‘K’ that can
be ordered.  This function is useful when you want to sort a slice by a
particular attribute of each item.  In Listing 13-7, we have a list of
‘Rectangle’ instances and we use ‘sort_by_key’ to order them by their
‘width’ attribute from low to high:

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle { width: 10, height: 1 },
        Rectangle { width: 3, height: 5 },
        Rectangle { width: 7, height: 12 },
    ];

    list.sort_by_key(|r| r.width);
    println!("{list:#?}");
}

This code prints:

$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.41s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
[
    Rectangle {
        width: 3,
        height: 5,
    },
    Rectangle {
        width: 7,
        height: 12,
    },
    Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 1,
    },
]

The reason ‘sort_by_key’ is defined to take an ‘FnMut’ closure is that
it calls the closure multiple times: once for each item in the slice.
The closure ‘|r| r.width’ doesn't capture, mutate, or move out anything
from its environment, so it meets the trait bound requirements.

In contrast, Listing 13-8 shows an example of a closure that implements
just the ‘FnOnce’ trait, because it moves a value out of the
environment.  The compiler won't let us use this closure with
‘sort_by_key’:

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle { width: 10, height: 1 },
        Rectangle { width: 3, height: 5 },
        Rectangle { width: 7, height: 12 },
    ];

    let mut sort_operations = vec![];
    let value = String::from("closure called");

    list.sort_by_key(|r| {
        sort_operations.push(value);
        r.width
    });
    println!("{list:#?}");
}

This is a contrived, convoluted way (that doesn't work) to try and count
the number of times ‘sort_by_key’ calls the closure when sorting ‘list’.
This code attempts to do this counting by pushing ‘value’--a ‘String’
from the closure's environment--into the ‘sort_operations’ vector.  The
closure captures ‘value’ then moves ‘value’ out of the closure by
transferring ownership of ‘value’ to the ‘sort_operations’ vector.  This
closure can be called once; trying to call it a second time wouldn't
work because ‘value’ would no longer be in the environment to be pushed
into ‘sort_operations’ again!  Therefore, this closure only implements
‘FnOnce’.  When we try to compile this code, we get this error that
‘value’ can't be moved out of the closure because the closure must
implement ‘FnMut’:

$ cargo run

The error points to the line in the closure body that moves ‘value’ out
of the environment.  To fix this, we need to change the closure body so
that it doesn't move values out of the environment.  To count the number
of times the closure is called, keeping a counter in the environment and
incrementing its value in the closure body is a more straightforward way
to calculate that.  The closure in Listing 13-9 works with ‘sort_by_key’
because it is only capturing a mutable reference to the
‘num_sort_operations’ counter and can therefore be called more than
once:

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle { width: 10, height: 1 },
        Rectangle { width: 3, height: 5 },
        Rectangle { width: 7, height: 12 },
    ];

    let mut num_sort_operations = 0;
    list.sort_by_key(|r| {
        num_sort_operations += 1;
        r.width
    });
    println!("{list:#?}, sorted in {num_sort_operations} operations");
}

The ‘Fn’ traits are important when defining or using functions or types
that make use of closures.  In the next section, we'll discuss
iterators.  Many iterator methods take closure arguments, so keep these
closure details in mind as we continue!

16.1.2 Processing a Series of Items with Iterators
--------------------------------------------------

The iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of
items in turn.  An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating
over each item and determining when the sequence has finished.  When you
use iterators, you don't have to reimplement that logic yourself.

In Rust, iterators are ‘lazy’, meaning they have no effect until you
call methods that consume the iterator to use it up.  For example, the
code in Listing 13-10 creates an iterator over the items in the vector
‘v1’ by calling the ‘iter’ method defined on ‘Vec<T>’.  This code by
itself doesn't do anything useful.

    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

The iterator is stored in the ‘v1_iter’ variable.  Once we've created an
iterator, we can use it in a variety of ways.  In Listing 3-5 in Chapter
3, we iterated over an array using a ‘for’ loop to execute some code on
each of its items.  Under the hood this implicitly created and then
consumed an iterator, but we glossed over how exactly that works until
now.

In the example in Listing 13-11, we separate the creation of the
iterator from the use of the iterator in the ‘for’ loop.  When the ‘for’
loop is called using the iterator in ‘v1_iter’, each element in the
iterator is used in one iteration of the loop, which prints out each
value.

    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

    for val in v1_iter {
        println!("Got: {val}");
    }

In languages that don't have iterators provided by their standard
libraries, you would likely write this same functionality by starting a
variable at index 0, using that variable to index into the vector to get
a value, and incrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached
the total number of items in the vector.

Iterators handle all that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code
you could potentially mess up.  Iterators give you more flexibility to
use the same logic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data
structures you can index into, like vectors.  Let's examine how
iterators do that.

16.1.2.1 The ‘Iterator’ Trait and the ‘next’ Method
...................................................

All iterators implement a trait named ‘Iterator’ that is defined in the
standard library.  The definition of the trait looks like this:

pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;

    // methods with default implementations elided
}

Notice this definition uses some new syntax: ‘type Item’ and
‘Self::Item’, which are defining an ‘associated type’ with this trait.
We'll talk about associated types in depth in Chapter 20.  For now, all
you need to know is that this code says implementing the ‘Iterator’
trait requires that you also define an ‘Item’ type, and this ‘Item’ type
is used in the return type of the ‘next’ method.  In other words, the
‘Item’ type will be the type returned from the iterator.

The ‘Iterator’ trait only requires implementors to define one method:
the ‘next’ method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time
wrapped in ‘Some’ and, when iteration is over, returns ‘None’.

We can call the ‘next’ method on iterators directly; Listing 13-12
demonstrates what values are returned from repeated calls to ‘next’ on
the iterator created from the vector.

    fn iterator_demonstration() {
        let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

        let mut v1_iter = v1.iter();

        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&1));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&2));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&3));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), None);
    }

Note that we needed to make ‘v1_iter’ mutable: calling the ‘next’ method
on an iterator changes internal state that the iterator uses to keep
track of where it is in the sequence.  In other words, this code
‘consumes’, or uses up, the iterator.  Each call to ‘next’ eats up an
item from the iterator.  We didn't need to make ‘v1_iter’ mutable when
we used a ‘for’ loop because the loop took ownership of ‘v1_iter’ and
made it mutable behind the scenes.

Also note that the values we get from the calls to ‘next’ are immutable
references to the values in the vector.  The ‘iter’ method produces an
iterator over immutable references.  If we want to create an iterator
that takes ownership of ‘v1’ and returns owned values, we can call
‘into_iter’ instead of ‘iter’.  Similarly, if we want to iterate over
mutable references, we can call ‘iter_mut’ instead of ‘iter’.

16.1.2.2 Methods that Consume the Iterator
..........................................

The ‘Iterator’ trait has a number of different methods with default
implementations provided by the standard library; you can find out about
these methods by looking in the standard library API documentation for
the ‘Iterator’ trait.  Some of these methods call the ‘next’ method in
their definition, which is why you're required to implement the ‘next’
method when implementing the ‘Iterator’ trait.

Methods that call ‘next’ are called ‘consuming adapters’, because
calling them uses up the iterator.  One example is the ‘sum’ method,
which takes ownership of the iterator and iterates through the items by
repeatedly calling ‘next’, thus consuming the iterator.  As it iterates
through, it adds each item to a running total and returns the total when
iteration is complete.  Listing 13-13 has a test illustrating a use of
the ‘sum’ method:

    fn iterator_sum() {
        let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

        let v1_iter = v1.iter();

        let total: i32 = v1_iter.sum();

        assert_eq!(total, 6);
    }

We aren't allowed to use ‘v1_iter’ after the call to ‘sum’ because ‘sum’
takes ownership of the iterator we call it on.

16.1.2.3 Methods that Produce Other Iterators
.............................................

‘Iterator adapters’ are methods defined on the ‘Iterator’ trait that
don't consume the iterator.  Instead, they produce different iterators
by changing some aspect of the original iterator.

Listing 13-14 shows an example of calling the iterator adapter method
‘map’, which takes a closure to call on each item as the items are
iterated through.  The ‘map’ method returns a new iterator that produces
the modified items.  The closure here creates a new iterator in which
each item from the vector will be incremented by 1:

    let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1);

However, this code produces a warning:

$ cargo run
   Compiling iterators v0.1.0 (file:///projects/iterators)

warning: `iterators` (bin "iterators") generated 1 warning
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.47s
     Running `target/debug/iterators`

The code in Listing 13-14 doesn't do anything; the closure we've
specified never gets called.  The warning reminds us why: iterator
adapters are lazy, and we need to consume the iterator here.

To fix this warning and consume the iterator, we'll use the ‘collect’
method, which we used in Chapter 12 with ‘env::args’ in Listing 12-1.
This method consumes the iterator and collects the resulting values into
a collection data type.

In Listing 13-15, we collect the results of iterating over the iterator
that's returned from the call to ‘map’ into a vector.  This vector will
end up containing each item from the original vector incremented by 1.

    let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v2: Vec<_> = v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();

    assert_eq!(v2, vec![2, 3, 4]);

Because ‘map’ takes a closure, we can specify any operation we want to
perform on each item.  This is a great example of how closures let you
customize some behavior while reusing the iteration behavior that the
‘Iterator’ trait provides.

You can chain multiple calls to iterator adapters to perform complex
actions in a readable way.  But because all iterators are lazy, you have
to call one of the consuming adapter methods to get results from calls
to iterator adapters.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Using Closures that Capture Their Environment,  Next: Improving Our I/O Project,  Prev: Methods that Produce Other Iterators,  Up: Processing a Series of Items with Iterators

16.1.2.4 Using Closures that Capture Their Environment
......................................................

Many iterator adapters take closures as arguments, and commonly the
closures we'll specify as arguments to iterator adapters will be
closures that capture their environment.

For this example, we'll use the ‘filter’ method that takes a closure.
The closure gets an item from the iterator and returns a ‘bool’.  If the
closure returns ‘true’, the value will be included in the iteration
produced by ‘filter’.  If the closure returns ‘false’, the value won't
be included.

In Listing 13-16, we use ‘filter’ with a closure that captures the
‘shoe_size’ variable from its environment to iterate over a collection
of ‘Shoe’ struct instances.  It will return only shoes that are the
specified size.

struct Shoe {
    size: u32,
    style: String,
}

fn shoes_in_size(shoes: Vec<Shoe>, shoe_size: u32) -> Vec<Shoe> {
    shoes.into_iter().filter(|s| s.size == shoe_size).collect()
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn filters_by_size() {
        let shoes = vec![
            Shoe {
                size: 10,
                style: String::from("sneaker"),
            },
            Shoe {
                size: 13,
                style: String::from("sandal"),
            },
            Shoe {
                size: 10,
                style: String::from("boot"),
            },
        ];

        let in_my_size = shoes_in_size(shoes, 10);

        assert_eq!(
            in_my_size,
            vec![
                Shoe {
                    size: 10,
                    style: String::from("sneaker")
                },
                Shoe {
                    size: 10,
                    style: String::from("boot")
                },
            ]
        );
    }
}

The ‘shoes_in_size’ function takes ownership of a vector of shoes and a
shoe size as parameters.  It returns a vector containing only shoes of
the specified size.

In the body of ‘shoes_in_size’, we call ‘into_iter’ to create an
iterator that takes ownership of the vector.  Then we call ‘filter’ to
adapt that iterator into a new iterator that only contains elements for
which the closure returns ‘true’.

The closure captures the ‘shoe_size’ parameter from the environment and
compares the value with each shoe's size, keeping only shoes of the size
specified.  Finally, calling ‘collect’ gathers the values returned by
the adapted iterator into a vector that's returned by the function.

The test shows that when we call ‘shoes_in_size’, we get back only shoes
that have the same size as the value we specified.

16.1.3 Improving Our I/O Project
--------------------------------

With this new knowledge about iterators, we can improve the I/O project
in Chapter 12 by using iterators to make places in the code clearer and
more concise.  Let's look at how iterators can improve our
implementation of the ‘Config::build’ function and the ‘search’
function.

* Choosing Between Loops or Iterators::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Removing a clone Using an Iterator,  Next: Making Code Clearer with Iterator Adapters,  Prev: Improving Our I/O Project,  Up: Improving Our I/O Project

16.1.3.1 Removing a ‘clone’ Using an Iterator
.............................................

In Listing 12-6, we added code that took a slice of ‘String’ values and
created an instance of the ‘Config’ struct by indexing into the slice
and cloning the values, allowing the ‘Config’ struct to own those
values.  In Listing 13-17, we've reproduced the implementation of the
‘Config::build’ function as it was in Listing 12-23:

impl Config {
    pub fn build(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let file_path = args[2].clone();

        let ignore_case = env::var("IGNORE_CASE").is_ok();

        Ok(Config {
            query,
            file_path,
            ignore_case,
        })
    }
}

At the time, we said not to worry about the inefficient ‘clone’ calls
because we would remove them in the future.  Well, that time is now!

We needed ‘clone’ here because we have a slice with ‘String’ elements in
the parameter ‘args’, but the ‘build’ function doesn't own ‘args’.  To
return ownership of a ‘Config’ instance, we had to clone the values from
the ‘query’ and ‘file_path’ fields of ‘Config’ so the ‘Config’ instance
can own its values.

With our new knowledge about iterators, we can change the ‘build’
function to take ownership of an iterator as its argument instead of
borrowing a slice.  We'll use the iterator functionality instead of the
code that checks the length of the slice and indexes into specific
locations.  This will clarify what the ‘Config::build’ function is doing
because the iterator will access the values.

Once ‘Config::build’ takes ownership of the iterator and stops using
indexing operations that borrow, we can move the ‘String’ values from
the iterator into ‘Config’ rather than calling ‘clone’ and making a new
allocation.  Using the Returned Iterator Directly Open your I/O
project's ‘src/main.rs’ file, which should look like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::build(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!("Problem parsing arguments: {err}");
        process::exit(1);
    });

    // --snip--
}

We'll first change the start of the ‘main’ function that we had in
Listing 12-24 to the code in Listing 13-18, which this time uses an
iterator.  This won't compile until we update ‘Config::build’ as well.

fn main() {
    let config = Config::build(env::args()).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!("Problem parsing arguments: {err}");
        process::exit(1);
    });

    // --snip--
}

The ‘env::args’ function returns an iterator!  Rather than collecting
the iterator values into a vector and then passing a slice to
‘Config::build’, now we're passing ownership of the iterator returned
from ‘env::args’ to ‘Config::build’ directly.

Next, we need to update the definition of ‘Config::build’.  In your I/O
project's ‘src/lib.rs’ file, let's change the signature of
‘Config::build’ to look like Listing 13-19.  This still won't compile
because we need to update the function body.

impl Config {
    pub fn build(
        mut args: impl Iterator<Item = String>,
    ) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        // --snip--

The standard library documentation for the ‘env::args’ function shows
that the type of the iterator it returns is ‘std::env::Args’, and that
type implements the ‘Iterator’ trait and returns ‘String’ values.

We've updated the signature of the ‘Config::build’ function so the
parameter ‘args’ has a generic type with the trait bounds ‘impl
Iterator<Item = String>’ instead of ‘&[String]’.  This usage of the
‘impl Trait’ syntax we discussed in the *note “Traits as Parameters”:
Traits as Parameters. section of Chapter 10 means that ‘args’ can be any
type that implements the ‘Iterator’ trait and returns ‘String’ items.

Because we're taking ownership of ‘args’ and we'll be mutating ‘args’ by
iterating over it, we can add the ‘mut’ keyword into the specification
of the ‘args’ parameter to make it mutable.  Using ‘Iterator’ Trait
Methods Instead of Indexing Next, we'll fix the body of ‘Config::build’.
Because ‘args’ implements the ‘Iterator’ trait, we know we can call the
‘next’ method on it!  Listing 13-20 updates the code from Listing 12-23
to use the ‘next’ method:

impl Config {
    pub fn build(
        mut args: impl Iterator<Item = String>,
    ) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        args.next();

        let query = match args.next() {
            Some(arg) => arg,
            None => return Err("Didn't get a query string"),
        };

        let file_path = match args.next() {
            Some(arg) => arg,
            None => return Err("Didn't get a file path"),
        };

        let ignore_case = env::var("IGNORE_CASE").is_ok();

        Ok(Config {
            query,
            file_path,
            ignore_case,
        })
    }
}

Remember that the first value in the return value of ‘env::args’ is the
name of the program.  We want to ignore that and get to the next value,
so first we call ‘next’ and do nothing with the return value.  Second,
we call ‘next’ to get the value we want to put in the ‘query’ field of
‘Config’.  If ‘next’ returns a ‘Some’, we use a ‘match’ to extract the
value.  If it returns ‘None’, it means not enough arguments were given
and we return early with an ‘Err’ value.  We do the same thing for the
‘file_path’ value.

16.1.3.2 Making Code Clearer with Iterator Adapters
...................................................

We can also take advantage of iterators in the ‘search’ function in our
I/O project, which is reproduced here in Listing 13-21 as it was in
Listing 12-19:

pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}

We can write this code in a more concise way using iterator adapter
methods.  Doing so also lets us avoid having a mutable intermediate
‘results’ vector.  The functional programming style prefers to minimize
the amount of mutable state to make code clearer.  Removing the mutable
state might enable a future enhancement to make searching happen in
parallel, because we wouldn't have to manage concurrent access to the
‘results’ vector.  Listing 13-22 shows this change:

pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    contents
        .lines()
        .filter(|line| line.contains(query))
        .collect()
}

Recall that the purpose of the ‘search’ function is to return all lines
in ‘contents’ that contain the ‘query’.  Similar to the ‘filter’ example
in Listing 13-16, this code uses the ‘filter’ adapter to keep only the
lines that ‘line.contains(query)’ returns ‘true’ for.  We then collect
the matching lines into another vector with ‘collect’.  Much simpler!
Feel free to make the same change to use iterator methods in the
‘search_case_insensitive’ function as well.

16.1.3.3 Choosing Between Loops or Iterators
............................................

The next logical question is which style you should choose in your own
code and why: the original implementation in Listing 13-21 or the
version using iterators in Listing 13-22.  Most Rust programmers prefer
to use the iterator style.  It's a bit tougher to get the hang of at
first, but once you get a feel for the various iterator adapters and
what they do, iterators can be easier to understand.  Instead of
fiddling with the various bits of looping and building new vectors, the
code focuses on the high-level objective of the loop.  This abstracts
away some of the commonplace code so it's easier to see the concepts
that are unique to this code, such as the filtering condition each
element in the iterator must pass.

But are the two implementations truly equivalent?  The intuitive
assumption might be that the more low-level loop will be faster.  Let's
talk about performance.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Comparing Performance Loops vs Iterators,  Next: Summary 13,  Prev: Improving Our I/O Project,  Up: Functional Language Features Iterators and Closures

16.1.4 Comparing Performance: Loops vs. Iterators
-------------------------------------------------

To determine whether to use loops or iterators, you need to know which
implementation is faster: the version of the ‘search’ function with an
explicit ‘for’ loop or the version with iterators.

We ran a benchmark by loading the entire contents of ‘The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes’ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into a ‘String’ and looking
for the word ‘the’ in the contents.  Here are the results of the
benchmark on the version of ‘search’ using the ‘for’ loop and the
version using iterators:

test bench_search_for  ... bench:  19,620,300 ns/iter (+/- 915,700)
test bench_search_iter ... bench:  19,234,900 ns/iter (+/- 657,200)

The iterator version was slightly faster!  We won't explain the
benchmark code here, because the point is not to prove that the two
versions are equivalent but to get a general sense of how these two
implementations compare performance-wise.

For a more comprehensive benchmark, you should check using various texts
of various sizes as the ‘contents’, different words and words of
different lengths as the ‘query’, and all kinds of other variations.
The point is this: iterators, although a high-level abstraction, get
compiled down to roughly the same code as if you'd written the
lower-level code yourself.  Iterators are one of Rust's ‘zero-cost
abstractions’, by which we mean using the abstraction imposes no
additional runtime overhead.  This is analogous to how Bjarne
Stroustrup, the original designer and implementor of C++, defines
‘zero-overhead’ in “Foundations of C++” (2012):

In general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What
you don't use, you don't pay for.  And further: What you do use, you
couldn't hand code any better.

As another example, the following code is taken from an audio decoder.
The decoding algorithm uses the linear prediction mathematical operation
to estimate future values based on a linear function of the previous
samples.  This code uses an iterator chain to do some math on three
variables in scope: a ‘buffer’ slice of data, an array of 12
‘coefficients’, and an amount by which to shift data in ‘qlp_shift’.
We've declared the variables within this example but not given them any
values; although this code doesn't have much meaning outside of its
context, it's still a concise, real-world example of how Rust translates
high-level ideas to low-level code.

let buffer: &mut [i32];
let coefficients: [i64; 12];
let qlp_shift: i16;

for i in 12..buffer.len() {
    let prediction = coefficients.iter()
                                 .zip(&buffer[i - 12..i])
                                 .map(|(&c, &s)| c * s as i64)
                                 .sum::<i64>() >> qlp_shift;
    let delta = buffer[i];
    buffer[i] = prediction as i32 + delta;
}

To calculate the value of ‘prediction’, this code iterates through each
of the 12 values in ‘coefficients’ and uses the ‘zip’ method to pair the
coefficient values with the previous 12 values in ‘buffer’.  Then, for
each pair, we multiply the values together, sum all the results, and
shift the bits in the sum ‘qlp_shift’ bits to the right.

Calculations in applications like audio decoders often prioritize
performance most highly.  Here, we're creating an iterator, using two
adapters, and then consuming the value.  What assembly code would this
Rust code compile to?  Well, as of this writing, it compiles down to the
same assembly you'd write by hand.  There's no loop at all corresponding
to the iteration over the values in ‘coefficients’: Rust knows that
there are 12 iterations, so it “unrolls” the loop.  ‘Unrolling’ is an
optimization that removes the overhead of the loop controlling code and
instead generates repetitive code for each iteration of the loop.

All of the coefficients get stored in registers, which means accessing
the values is very fast.  There are no bounds checks on the array access
at runtime.  All these optimizations that Rust is able to apply make the
resulting code extremely efficient.  Now that you know this, you can use
iterators and closures without fear!  They make code seem like it's
higher level but don't impose a runtime performance penalty for doing
so.

16.1.5 Summary
--------------

Closures and iterators are Rust features inspired by functional
programming language ideas.  They contribute to Rust's capability to
clearly express high-level ideas at low-level performance.  The
implementations of closures and iterators are such that runtime
performance is not affected.  This is part of Rust's goal to strive to
provide zero-cost abstractions.

Now that we've improved the expressiveness of our I/O project, let's
look at some more features of ‘cargo’ that will help us share the
project with the world.

*********************************

So far we've used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run,
and test our code, but it can do a lot more.  In this chapter, we'll
discuss some of its other, more advanced features to show you how to do
the following:

   • Customize your build through release profiles
   • Publish libraries on cratesio (https://crates.io/)
   • Organize large projects with workspaces
   • Install binaries from cratesio (https://crates.io/)
   • Extend Cargo using custom commands

Cargo can do even more than the functionality we cover in this chapter,

17.1 Customizing Builds with Release Profiles
=============================================

In Rust, ‘release profiles’ are predefined and customizable profiles
with different configurations that allow a programmer to have more
control over various options for compiling code.  Each profile is
configured independently of the others.

Cargo has two main profiles: the ‘dev’ profile Cargo uses when you run
‘cargo build’ and the ‘release’ profile Cargo uses when you run ‘cargo
build --release’.  The ‘dev’ profile is defined with good defaults for
development, and the ‘release’ profile has good defaults for release
builds.

These profile names might be familiar from the output of your builds:

$ cargo build
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
$ cargo build --release
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.32s

The ‘dev’ and ‘release’ are these different profiles used by the
compiler.

Cargo has default settings for each of the profiles that apply when you
haven't explicitly added any ‘[profile.*]’ sections in the project's
‘Cargo.toml’ file.  By adding ‘[profile.*]’ sections for any profile you
want to customize, you override any subset of the default settings.  For
example, here are the default values for the ‘opt-level’ setting for the
‘dev’ and ‘release’ profiles:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3

The ‘opt-level’ setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will
apply to your code, with a range of 0 to 3.  Applying more optimizations
extends compiling time, so if you're in development and compiling your
code often, you'll want fewer optimizations to compile faster even if
the resulting code runs slower.  The default ‘opt-level’ for ‘dev’ is
therefore ‘0’.  When you're ready to release your code, it's best to
spend more time compiling.  You'll only compile in release mode once,
but you'll run the compiled program many times, so release mode trades
longer compile time for code that runs faster.  That is why the default
‘opt-level’ for the ‘release’ profile is ‘3’.

You can override a default setting by adding a different value for it in
‘Cargo.toml’.  For example, if we want to use optimization level 1 in
the development profile, we can add these two lines to our project's
‘Cargo.toml’ file:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1

This code overrides the default setting of ‘0’.  Now when we run ‘cargo
build’, Cargo will use the defaults for the ‘dev’ profile plus our
customization to ‘opt-level’.  Because we set ‘opt-level’ to ‘1’, Cargo
will apply more optimizations than the default, but not as many as in a
release build.

For the full list of configuration options and defaults for each
profile, see Cargo's documentation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html).

17.1.1 Publishing a Crate to Crates.io
--------------------------------------

We've used packages from cratesio (https://crates.io/) as dependencies
of our project, but you can also share your code with other people by
publishing your own packages.  The crate registry at cratesio
(https://crates.io/) distributes the source code of your packages, so it
primarily hosts code that is open source.

Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for
people to find and use.  We'll talk about some of these features next
and then explain how to publish a package.

17.1.1.1 Making Useful Documentation Comments
.............................................

Accurately documenting your packages will help other users know how and
when to use them, so it's worth investing the time to write
documentation.  In Chapter 3, we discussed how to comment Rust code
using two slashes, ‘//’.  Rust also has a particular kind of comment for
documentation, known conveniently as a ‘documentation comment’, that
will generate HTML documentation.  The HTML displays the contents of
documentation comments for public API items intended for programmers
interested in knowing how to ‘use’ your crate as opposed to how your
crate is ‘implemented’.

Documentation comments use three slashes, ‘///’, instead of two and
support Markdown notation for formatting the text.  Place documentation
comments just before the item they're documenting.  Listing 14-1 shows
documentation comments for an ‘add_one’ function in a crate named
‘my_crate’.

/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

Here, we give a description of what the ‘add_one’ function does, start a
section with the heading ‘Examples’, and then provide code that
demonstrates how to use the ‘add_one’ function.  We can generate the
HTML documentation from this documentation comment by running ‘cargo
doc’.  This command runs the ‘rustdoc’ tool distributed with Rust and
puts the generated HTML documentation in the ‘target/doc’ directory.

For convenience, running ‘cargo doc --open’ will build the HTML for your
current crate's documentation (as well as the documentation for all of
your crate's dependencies) and open the result in a web browser.
Navigate to the ‘add_one’ function and you'll see how the text in the
documentation comments is rendered, as shown in Figure 14-1:

Figure 14-1: HTML documentation for the ‘add_one’ function Commonly Used
Sections We used the ‘# Examples’ Markdown heading in Listing 14-1 to
create a section in the HTML with the title “Examples.” Here are some
other sections that crate authors commonly use in their documentation:

   • *Panics*: The scenarios in which the function being documented
     could panic.  Callers of the function who don't want their programs
     to panic should make sure they don't call the function in these
     situations.
   • *Errors*: If the function returns a ‘Result’, describing the kinds
     of errors that might occur and what conditions might cause those
     errors to be returned can be helpful to callers so they can write
     code to handle the different kinds of errors in different ways.
   • *Safety*: If the function is ‘unsafe’ to call (we discuss unsafety
     in Chapter 20), there should be a section explaining why the
     function is unsafe and covering the invariants that the function
     expects callers to uphold.

Most documentation comments don't need all of these sections, but this
is a good checklist to remind you of the aspects of your code users will
be interested in knowing about.  Documentation Comments as Tests Adding
example code blocks in your documentation comments can help demonstrate
how to use your library, and doing so has an additional bonus: running
‘cargo test’ will run the code examples in your documentation as tests!
Nothing is better than documentation with examples.  But nothing is
worse than examples that don't work because the code has changed since
the documentation was written.  If we run ‘cargo test’ with the
documentation for the ‘add_one’ function from Listing 14-1, we will see
a section in the test results like this:

   Doc-tests my_crate

running 1 test
test src/lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.27s

Now if we change either the function or the example so the ‘assert_eq!’
in the example panics and run ‘cargo test’ again, we'll see that the doc
tests catch that the example and the code are out of sync with each
other!  Commenting Contained Items The style of doc comment ‘//!’ adds
documentation to the item that contains the comments rather than to the
items following the comments.  We typically use these doc comments
inside the crate root file (‘src/lib.rs’ by convention) or inside a
module to document the crate or the module as a whole.

For example, to add documentation that describes the purpose of the
‘my_crate’ crate that contains the ‘add_one’ function, we add
documentation comments that start with ‘//!’ to the beginning of the
‘src/lib.rs’ file, as shown in Listing 14-2:

//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
// --snip--

Notice there isn't any code after the last line that begins with ‘//!’.
Because we started the comments with ‘//!’ instead of ‘///’, we're
documenting the item that contains this comment rather than an item that
follows this comment.  In this case, that item is the ‘src/lib.rs’ file,
which is the crate root.  These comments describe the entire crate.

When we run ‘cargo doc --open’, these comments will display on the front
page of the documentation for ‘my_crate’ above the list of public items
in the crate, as shown in Figure 14-2:

Figure 14-2: Rendered documentation for ‘my_crate’, including the
comment describing the crate as a whole

Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and
modules especially.  Use them to explain the overall purpose of the
container to help your users understand the crate's organization.

17.1.1.2 Exporting a Convenient Public API with ‘pub use’
.........................................................

The structure of your public API is a major consideration when
publishing a crate.  People who use your crate are less familiar with
the structure than you are and might have difficulty finding the pieces
they want to use if your crate has a large module hierarchy.

In Chapter 7, we covered how to make items public using the ‘pub’
keyword, and bring items into a scope with the ‘use’ keyword.  However,
the structure that makes sense to you while you're developing a crate
might not be very convenient for your users.  You might want to organize
your structs in a hierarchy containing multiple levels, but then people
who want to use a type you've defined deep in the hierarchy might have
trouble finding out that type exists.  They might also be annoyed at
having to enter ‘use’
‘my_crate::some_module::another_module::UsefulType;’ rather than ‘use’
‘my_crate::UsefulType;’.

The good news is that if the structure ‘isn't’ convenient for others to
use from another library, you don't have to rearrange your internal
organization: instead, you can re-export items to make a public
structure that's different from your private structure by using ‘pub
use’.  Re-exporting takes a public item in one location and makes it
public in another location, as if it were defined in the other location
instead.

For example, say we made a library named ‘art’ for modeling artistic
concepts.  Within this library are two modules: a ‘kinds’ module
containing two enums named ‘PrimaryColor’ and ‘SecondaryColor’ and a
‘utils’ module containing a function named ‘mix’, as shown in Listing
14-3:

//! # Art
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub mod kinds {
    /// The primary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum PrimaryColor {
        Red,
        Yellow,
        Blue,
    }

    /// The secondary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum SecondaryColor {
        Orange,
        Green,
        Purple,
    }
}

pub mod utils {
    use crate::kinds::*;

    /// Combines two primary colors in equal amounts to create
    /// a secondary color.
    pub fn mix(c1: PrimaryColor, c2: PrimaryColor) -> SecondaryColor {
        // --snip--
    }
}

Figure 14-3 shows what the front page of the documentation for this
crate generated by ‘cargo doc’ would look like:

Figure 14-3: Front page of the documentation for ‘art’ that lists the
‘kinds’ and ‘utils’ modules

Note that the ‘PrimaryColor’ and ‘SecondaryColor’ types aren't listed on
the front page, nor is the ‘mix’ function.  We have to click ‘kinds’ and
‘utils’ to see them.

Another crate that depends on this library would need ‘use’ statements
that bring the items from ‘art’ into scope, specifying the module
structure that's currently defined.  Listing 14-4 shows an example of a
crate that uses the ‘PrimaryColor’ and ‘mix’ items from the ‘art’ crate:

use art::kinds::PrimaryColor;
use art::utils::mix;

fn main() {
    let red = PrimaryColor::Red;
    let yellow = PrimaryColor::Yellow;
    mix(red, yellow);
}

The author of the code in Listing 14-4, which uses the ‘art’ crate, had
to figure out that ‘PrimaryColor’ is in the ‘kinds’ module and ‘mix’ is
in the ‘utils’ module.  The module structure of the ‘art’ crate is more
relevant to developers working on the ‘art’ crate than to those using
it.  The internal structure doesn't contain any useful information for
someone trying to understand how to use the ‘art’ crate, but rather
causes confusion because developers who use it have to figure out where
to look, and must specify the module names in the ‘use’ statements.

To remove the internal organization from the public API, we can modify
the ‘art’ crate code in Listing 14-3 to add ‘pub use’ statements to
re-export the items at the top level, as shown in Listing 14-5:

//! # Art
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub use self::kinds::PrimaryColor;
pub use self::kinds::SecondaryColor;
pub use self::utils::mix;

pub mod kinds {
    // --snip--
}

pub mod utils {
    // --snip--
}

The API documentation that ‘cargo doc’ generates for this crate will now
list and link re-exports on the front page, as shown in Figure 14-4,
making the ‘PrimaryColor’ and ‘SecondaryColor’ types and the ‘mix’
function easier to find.

Figure 14-4: The front page of the documentation for ‘art’ that lists
the re-exports

The ‘art’ crate users can still see and use the internal structure from
Listing 14-3 as demonstrated in Listing 14-4, or they can use the more
convenient structure in Listing 14-5, as shown in Listing 14-6:

use art::mix;
use art::PrimaryColor;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
}

In cases where there are many nested modules, re-exporting the types at
the top level with ‘pub use’ can make a significant difference in the
experience of people who use the crate.  Another common use of ‘pub use’
is to re-export definitions of a dependency in the current crate to make
that crate's definitions part of your crate's public API.

Creating a useful public API structure is more of an art than a science,
and you can iterate to find the API that works best for your users.
Choosing ‘pub use’ gives you flexibility in how you structure your crate
internally and decouples that internal structure from what you present
to your users.  Look at some of the code of crates you've installed to
see if their internal structure differs from their public API.

17.1.1.3 Setting Up a Crates.io Account
.......................................

Before you can publish any crates, you need to create an account on
cratesio (https://crates.io/) and get an API token.  To do so, visit the
home page at cratesio (https://crates.io/) and log in via a GitHub
account.  (The GitHub account is currently a requirement, but the site
might support other ways of creating an account in the future.)  Once
you're logged in, visit your account settings at <https://crates.io/me/>
and retrieve your API key.  Then run the ‘cargo login’ command and paste
your API key when prompted, like this:

$ cargo login
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345

This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in
‘~/.cargo/credentials’.  Note that this token is a ‘secret’: do not
share it with anyone else.  If you do share it with anyone for any
reason, you should revoke it and generate a new token on cratesio
(https://crates.io/).


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Adding Metadata to a New Crate,  Next: Publishing to Cratesio,  Prev: Setting Up a Cratesio Account,  Up: Publishing a Crate to Cratesio

17.1.1.4 Adding Metadata to a New Crate
.......................................

Let's say you have a crate you want to publish.  Before publishing,
you'll need to add some metadata in the ‘[package]’ section of the
crate's ‘Cargo.toml’ file.

Your crate will need a unique name.  While you're working on a crate
locally, you can name a crate whatever you'd like.  However, crate names
on cratesio (https://crates.io/) are allocated on a first-come,
first-served basis.  Once a crate name is taken, no one else can publish
a crate with that name.  Before attempting to publish a crate, search
for the name you want to use.  If the name has been used, you will need
to find another name and edit the ‘name’ field in the ‘Cargo.toml’ file
under the ‘[package]’ section to use the new name for publishing, like
so:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[package]
name = "guessing_game"

Even if you've chosen a unique name, when you run ‘cargo publish’ to
publish the crate at this point, you'll get a warning and then an error:

$ cargo publish
    Updating crates.io index
warning: manifest has no description, license, license-file, documentation, homepage or repository.
See https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#package-metadata for more info.
--snip--
error: failed to publish to registry at https://crates.io

Caused by:
  the remote server responded with an error (status 400 Bad Request): missing or empty metadata fields: description, license. Please see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html for more information on configuring these field

This errors because you're missing some crucial information: a
description and license are required so people will know what your crate
does and under what terms they can use it.  In ‘Cargo.toml’, add a
description that's just a sentence or two, because it will appear with
your crate in search results.  For the ‘license’ field, you need to give
a ‘license identifier value’.  The Linux Foundation's Software Package
Data Exchange SPDX (http://spdx.org/licenses/) lists the identifiers you
can use for this value.  For example, to specify that you've licensed
your crate using the MIT License, add the ‘MIT’ identifier:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[package]
name = "guessing_game"
license = "MIT"

If you want to use a license that doesn't appear in the SPDX, you need
to place the text of that license in a file, include the file in your
project, and then use ‘license-file’ to specify the name of that file
instead of using the ‘license’ key.

Guidance on which license is appropriate for your project is beyond the
scope of this book.  Many people in the Rust community license their
projects in the same way as Rust by using a dual license of ‘MIT OR
Apache-2.0’.  This practice demonstrates that you can also specify
multiple license identifiers separated by ‘OR’ to have multiple licenses
for your project.

With a unique name, the version, your description, and a license added,
the ‘Cargo.toml’ file for a project that is ready to publish might look
like this:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[dependencies]

Cargo's documentation (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) describes other
metadata you can specify to ensure others can discover and use your
crate more easily.

17.1.1.5 Publishing to Crates.io
................................

Now that you've created an account, saved your API token, chosen a name
for your crate, and specified the required metadata, you're ready to
publish!  Publishing a crate uploads a specific version to cratesio
(https://crates.io/) for others to use.

Be careful, because a publish is ‘permanent’.  The version can never be
overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted.  One major goal of cratesio
(https://crates.io/) is to act as a permanent archive of code so that
builds of all projects that depend on crates from cratesio
(https://crates.io/) will continue to work.  Allowing version deletions
would make fulfilling that goal impossible.  However, there is no limit
to the number of crate versions you can publish.

Run the ‘cargo publish’ command again.  It should succeed now:

$ cargo publish
    Updating crates.io index
   Packaging guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
   Verifying guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0
(file:///projects/guessing_game/target/package/guessing_game-0.1.0)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
   Uploading guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)

Congratulations!  You've now shared your code with the Rust community,
and anyone can easily add your crate as a dependency of their project.

17.1.1.6 Publishing a New Version of an Existing Crate
......................................................

When you've made changes to your crate and are ready to release a new
version, you change the ‘version’ value specified in your ‘Cargo.toml’
file and republish.  Use the Semantic Versioning rules
(http://semver.org/) to decide what an appropriate next version number
is based on the kinds of changes you've made.  Then run ‘cargo publish’
to upload the new version.

17.1.1.7 Deprecating Versions from Crates.io with
.................................................

‘cargo yank’ Although you can't remove previous versions of a crate, you
can prevent any future projects from adding them as a new dependency.
This is useful when a crate version is broken for one reason or another.
In such situations, Cargo supports ‘yanking’ a crate version.

Yanking a version prevents new projects from depending on that version
while allowing all existing projects that depend on it to continue.
Essentially, a yank means that all projects with a ‘Cargo.lock’ will not
break, and any future ‘Cargo.lock’ files generated will not use the
yanked version.

To yank a version of a crate, in the directory of the crate that you've
previously published, run ‘cargo yank’ and specify which version you
want to yank.  For example, if we've published a crate named
‘guessing_game’ version 1.0.1 and we want to yank it, in the project
directory for ‘guessing_game’ we'd run:

$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
    Updating crates.io index
        Yank guessing_game@1.0.1

By adding ‘--undo’ to the command, you can also undo a yank and allow
projects to start depending on a version again:

$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
    Updating crates.io index
      Unyank guessing_game@1.0.1

A yank ‘does not’ delete any code.  It cannot, for example, delete
accidentally uploaded secrets.  If that happens, you must reset those
secrets immediately.

17.1.2 Cargo Workspaces
-----------------------

In Chapter 12, we built a package that included a binary crate and a
library crate.  As your project develops, you might find that the
library crate continues to get bigger and you want to split your package
further into multiple library crates.  Cargo offers a feature called
‘workspaces’ that can help manage multiple related packages that are
developed in tandem.

* Menu:

* Creating a Workspace::
* Creating the Second Package in the Workspace::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Creating a Workspace,  Next: Creating the Second Package in the Workspace,  Prev: Cargo Workspaces,  Up: Cargo Workspaces

17.1.2.1 Creating a Workspace
.............................

A ‘workspace’ is a set of packages that share the same ‘Cargo.lock’ and
output directory.  Let's make a project using a workspace--we'll use
trivial code so we can concentrate on the structure of the workspace.
There are multiple ways to structure a workspace, so we'll just show one
common way.  We'll have a workspace containing a binary and two
libraries.  The binary, which will provide the main functionality, will
depend on the two libraries.  One library will provide an ‘add_one’
function, and a second library an ‘add_two’ function.  These three
crates will be part of the same workspace.  We'll start by creating a
new directory for the workspace:

$ mkdir add
$ cd add

Next, in the ‘add’ directory, we create the ‘Cargo.toml’ file that will
configure the entire workspace.  This file won't have a ‘[package]’
section.  Instead, it will start with a ‘[workspace]’ section that will
allow us to add members to the workspace.  We also make a point to use
the latest and greatest version of Cargo's resolver algorithm in our
workspace by setting the ‘resolver’ to ‘"2"’.

by specifying the path to the package with our binary crate; in this
case, that path is ‘adder’:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[workspace]
resolver = "2"

Next, we'll create the ‘adder’ binary crate by running ‘cargo new’
within the ‘add’ directory:

$ cargo new adder
    Creating binary (application) `adder` package
      Adding `adder` as member of workspace at `file:///projects/add`

Running ‘cargo new’ inside a workspace also automatically adds the newly
created package to the ‘members’ key in the ‘[workspace]’ definition in
the workspace ‘Cargo.toml’, like this:

[workspace]
resolver = "2"
members = ["adder"]

At this point, we can build the workspace by running ‘cargo build’.  The
files in your ‘add’ directory should look like this:

├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target

The workspace has one ‘target’ directory at the top level that the
compiled artifacts will be placed into; the ‘adder’ package doesn't have
its own ‘target’ directory.  Even if we were to run ‘cargo build’ from
inside the ‘adder’ directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up
in ‘add/target’ rather than ‘add/adder/target’.  Cargo structures the
‘target’ directory in a workspace like this because the crates in a
workspace are meant to depend on each other.  If each crate had its own
‘target’ directory, each crate would have to recompile each of the other
crates in the workspace to place the artifacts in its own ‘target’
directory.  By sharing one ‘target’ directory, the crates can avoid
unnecessary rebuilding.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Creating the Second Package in the Workspace,  Next: Installing Binaries with cargo install,  Prev: Creating a Workspace,  Up: Cargo Workspaces

17.1.2.2 Creating the Second Package in the Workspace
.....................................................

Next, let's create another member package in the workspace and call it
‘add_one’.  Change the top-level ‘Cargo.toml’ to specify the ‘add_one’
path in the ‘members’ list:

Filename: Cargo.toml

[workspace]
resolver = "2"
members = ["adder", "add_one"]

Then generate a new library crate named ‘add_one’:

$ cargo new add_one --lib
    Creating library `add_one` package
      Adding `add_one` as member of workspace at `file:///projects/add`

Your ‘add’ directory should now have these directories and files:

├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── add_one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target

In the ‘add_one/src/lib.rs’ file, let's add an ‘add_one’ function:

Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs

pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

Now we can have the ‘adder’ package with our binary depend on the
‘add_one’ package that has our library.  First, we'll need to add a path
dependency on ‘add_one’ to ‘adder/Cargo.toml’.

Filename: adder/Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
add_one = { path = "../add_one" }

Cargo doesn't assume that crates in a workspace will depend on each
other, so we need to be explicit about the dependency relationships.

Next, let's use the ‘add_one’ function (from the ‘add_one’ crate) in the
‘adder’ crate.  Open the ‘adder/src/main.rs’ file and add a ‘use’ line
at the top to bring the new ‘add_one’ library crate into scope.  Then
change the ‘main’ function to call the ‘add_one’ function, as in Listing
14-7.

use add_one;

fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    println!("Hello, world! {num} plus one is {}!", add_one::add_one(num));
}

Let's build the workspace by running ‘cargo build’ in the top-level
‘add’ directory!

$ cargo build
   Compiling add_one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add_one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.22s

To run the binary crate from the ‘add’ directory, we can specify which
package in the workspace we want to run by using the ‘-p’ argument and
the package name with ‘cargo run’:

$ cargo run -p adder
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/adder`
Hello, world! 10 plus one is 11!

This runs the code in ‘adder/src/main.rs’, which depends on the
‘add_one’ crate.  Depending on an External Package in a Workspace Notice
that the workspace has only one ‘Cargo.lock’ file at the top level,
rather than having a ‘Cargo.lock’ in each crate's directory.  This
ensures that all crates are using the same version of all dependencies.
If we add the ‘rand’ package to the ‘adder/Cargo.toml’ and
‘add_one/Cargo.toml’ files, Cargo will resolve both of those to one
version of ‘rand’ and record that in the one ‘Cargo.lock’.  Making all
crates in the workspace use the same dependencies means the crates will
always be compatible with each other.  Let's add the ‘rand’ crate to the
‘[dependencies]’ section in the ‘add_one/Cargo.toml’ file so we can use
the ‘rand’ crate in the ‘add_one’ crate:

Filename: add_one/Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"

We can now add ‘use rand;’ to the ‘add_one/src/lib.rs’ file, and
building the whole workspace by running ‘cargo build’ in the ‘add’
directory will bring in and compile the ‘rand’ crate.  We will get one
warning because we aren't referring to the ‘rand’ we brought into scope:

$ cargo build
    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded rand v0.8.5
   --snip--
   Compiling rand v0.8.5
   Compiling add_one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add_one)

   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.95s

The top-level ‘Cargo.lock’ now contains information about the dependency
of ‘add_one’ on ‘rand’.  However, even though ‘rand’ is used somewhere
in the workspace, we can't use it in other crates in the workspace
unless we add ‘rand’ to their ‘Cargo.toml’ files as well.  For example,
if we add ‘use rand;’ to the ‘adder/src/main.rs’ file for the ‘adder’
package, we'll get an error:

$ cargo build
  --snip--
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rand`
 --> adder/src/main.rs:2:5
  |
2 | use rand;
  |     ^^^^ no external crate `rand`

To fix this, edit the ‘Cargo.toml’ file for the ‘adder’ package and
indicate that ‘rand’ is a dependency for it as well.  Building the
‘adder’ package will add ‘rand’ to the list of dependencies for ‘adder’
in ‘Cargo.lock’, but no additional copies of ‘rand’ will be downloaded.
Cargo will ensure that every crate in every package in the workspace
using the ‘rand’ package will be using the same version as long as they
specify compatible versions of ‘rand’, saving us space and ensuring that
the crates in the workspace will be compatible with each other.

If crates in the workspace specify incompatible versions of the same
dependency, Cargo will resolve each of them, but will still try to
resolve as few versions as possible.  Adding a Test to a Workspace For
another enhancement, let's add a test of the ‘add_one::add_one’ function
within the ‘add_one’ crate:

Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs

pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(3, add_one(2));
    }
}

Now run ‘cargo test’ in the top-level ‘add’ directory.  Running ‘cargo
test’ in a workspace structured like this one will run the tests for all
the crates in the workspace:

$ cargo test
   Compiling add_one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add_one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.20s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/add_one-f0253159197f7841)

test tests::it_works ... ok

     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-49979ff40686fa8e)

   Doc-tests add_one

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

The first section of the output shows that the ‘it_works’ test in the
‘add_one’ crate passed.  The next section shows that zero tests were
found in the ‘adder’ crate, and then the last section shows zero
documentation tests were found in the ‘add_one’ crate.

We can also run tests for one particular crate in a workspace from the
top-level directory by using the ‘-p’ flag and specifying the name of
the crate we want to test:

$ cargo test -p add_one
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/add_one-b3235fea9a156f74)

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests add_one

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

This output shows ‘cargo test’ only ran the tests for the ‘add_one’
crate and didn't run the ‘adder’ crate tests.

If you publish the crates in the workspace to cratesio
(https://crates.io/), each crate in the workspace will need to be
published separately.  Like ‘cargo test’, we can publish a particular
crate in our workspace by using the ‘-p’ flag and specifying the name of
the crate we want to publish.

For additional practice, add an ‘add_two’ crate to this workspace in a
similar way as the ‘add_one’ crate!

As your project grows, consider using a workspace: it's easier to
understand smaller, individual components than one big blob of code.
Furthermore, keeping the crates in a workspace can make coordination
between crates easier if they are often changed at the same time.

17.1.3 Installing Binaries with ‘cargo install’
-----------------------------------------------

The ‘cargo install’ command allows you to install and use binary crates
locally.  This isn't intended to replace system packages; it's meant to
be a convenient way for Rust developers to install tools that others
have shared on cratesio (https://crates.io/).  Note that you can only
install packages that have binary targets.  A ‘binary target’ is the
runnable program that is created if the crate has a ‘src/main.rs’ file
or another file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library target
that isn't runnable on its own but is suitable for including within
other programs.  Usually, crates have information in the ‘README’ file
about whether a crate is a library, has a binary target, or both.

All binaries installed with ‘cargo install’ are stored in the
installation root's ‘bin’ folder.  If you installed Rust using
‘rustup.rs’ and don't have any custom configurations, this directory
will be ‘$HOME/.cargo/bin’.  Ensure that directory is in your ‘$PATH’to
be able to run programs you've installed with‘cargo install’.

For example, in Chapter 12 we mentioned that there's a Rust
implementation of the ‘grep’ tool called ‘ripgrep’ for searching files.
To install ‘ripgrep’, we can run the following:

$ cargo install ripgrep
    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded ripgrep v13.0.0
  Downloaded 1 crate (243.3 KB) in 0.88s
  Installing ripgrep v13.0.0
--snip--
   Compiling ripgrep v13.0.0
    Finished `release` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 10.64s
  Installing ~/.cargo/bin/rg
   Installed package `ripgrep v13.0.0` (executable `rg`)

The second-to-last line of the output shows the location and the name of
the installed binary, which in the case of ‘ripgrep’ is ‘rg’.  As long
as the installation directory is in your ‘$PATH’, as mentioned
previously, you can then run ‘rg --help’ and start using a faster,
rustier tool for searching files!

17.1.4 Extending Cargo with Custom Commands
-------------------------------------------

Cargo is designed so you can extend it with new subcommands without
having to modify Cargo.  If a binary in your ‘$PATH’ is named
‘cargo-something’, you can run it as if it was a Cargo subcommand by
running ‘cargo something’.  Custom commands like this are also listed
when you run ‘cargo --list’.  Being able to use ‘cargo install’ to
install extensions and then run them just like the built-in Cargo tools
is a super convenient benefit of Cargo's design!

--------------

Sharing code with Cargo and cratesio (https://crates.io/) is part of
what makes the Rust ecosystem useful for many different tasks.  Rust's
standard library is small and stable, but crates are easy to share, use,
and improve on a timeline different from that of the language.  Don't be
shy about sharing code that's useful to you on cratesio
(https://crates.io/); it's likely that it will be useful to someone else
as well!

18 Smart Pointers
*****************

A ‘pointer’ is a general concept for a variable that contains an address
in memory.  This address refers to, or “points at,” some other data.
The most common kind of pointer in Rust is a reference, which you
learned about in Chapter 4.  References are indicated by the ‘&’ symbol
and borrow the value they point to.  They don't have any special
capabilities other than referring to data, and have no overhead.

‘Smart pointers’, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a
pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities.  The concept
of smart pointers isn't unique to Rust: smart pointers originated in C++
and exist in other languages as well.  Rust has a variety of smart
pointers defined in the standard library that provide functionality
beyond that provided by references.  To explore the general concept,
we'll look at a couple of different examples of smart pointers,
including a ‘reference counting’ smart pointer type.  This pointer
enables you to allow data to have multiple owners by keeping track of
the number of owners and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.

Rust, with its concept of ownership and borrowing, has an additional
difference between references and smart pointers: while references only
borrow data, in many cases, smart pointers ‘own’ the data they point to.

Though we didn't call them as such at the time, we've already
encountered a few smart pointers in this book, including ‘String’ and
‘Vec<T>’ in Chapter 8.  Both these types count as smart pointers because
they own some memory and allow you to manipulate it.  They also have
metadata and extra capabilities or guarantees.  ‘String’, for example,
stores its capacity as metadata and has the extra ability to ensure its
data will always be valid UTF-8.

Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs.  Unlike an
ordinary struct, smart pointers implement the ‘Deref’ and ‘Drop’ traits.
The ‘Deref’ trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to
behave like a reference so you can write your code to work with either
references or smart pointers.  The ‘Drop’ trait allows you to customize
the code that's run when an instance of the smart pointer goes out of
scope.  In this chapter, we'll discuss both traits and demonstrate why
they're important to smart pointers.

Given that the smart pointer pattern is a general design pattern used
frequently in Rust, this chapter won't cover every existing smart
pointer.  Many libraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even
write your own.  We'll cover the most common smart pointers in the
standard library:

   • ‘Box<T>’ for allocating values on the heap
   • ‘Rc<T>’, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
   • ‘Ref<T>’ and ‘RefMut<T>’, accessed through ‘RefCell<T>’, a type
     that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile
     time

In addition, we'll cover the ‘interior mutability’ pattern where an
immutable type exposes an API for mutating an interior value.  We'll
also discuss ‘reference cycles’: how they can leak memory and how to
prevent them.

Let's dive in!

18.1 Using ‘Box<T>’ to Point to Data on the Heap
================================================

The most straightforward smart pointer is a ‘box’, whose type is written
‘Box<T>’.  Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the
stack.  What remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data.
Refer to Chapter 4 to review the difference between the stack and the
heap.

Boxes don't have performance overhead, other than storing their data on
the heap instead of on the stack.  But they don't have many extra
capabilities either.  You'll use them most often in these situations:

   • When you have a type whose size can't be known at compile time and
     you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an
     exact size
   • When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer
     ownership but ensure the data won't be copied when you do so
   • When you want to own a value and you care only that it's a type
     that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific
     type

We'll demonstrate the first situation in the *note “Enabling Recursive
Types with Boxes”: Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes. section.  In the
second case, transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a
long time because the data is copied around on the stack.  To improve
performance in this situation, we can store the large amount of data on
the heap in a box.  Then, only the small amount of pointer data is
copied around on the stack, while the data it references stays in one
place on the heap.  The third case is known as a ‘trait object’, and
Chapter 18 devotes an entire section, *note “Using Trait Objects That
Allow for Values of Different Types”: Using Trait Objects That Allow for
Values of Different Types. just to that topic.  So what you learn here
you'll apply again in Chapter 18!

18.1.1 Using a ‘Box<T>’ to Store Data on the Heap
-------------------------------------------------

Before we discuss the heap storage use case for ‘Box<T>’, we'll cover
the syntax and how to interact with values stored within a ‘Box<T>’.

Listing 15-1 shows how to use a box to store an ‘i32’ value on the heap:

fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {b}");
}

We define the variable ‘b’ to have the value of a ‘Box’ that points to
the value ‘5’, which is allocated on the heap.  This program will print
‘b = 5’; in this case, we can access the data in the box similar to how
we would if this data were on the stack.  Just like any owned value,
when a box goes out of scope, as ‘b’ does at the end of ‘main’, it will
be deallocated.  The deallocation happens both for the box (stored on
the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap).

Putting a single value on the heap isn't very useful, so you won't use
boxes by themselves in this way very often.  Having values like a single
‘i32’ on the stack, where they're stored by default, is more appropriate
in the majority of situations.  Let's look at a case where boxes allow
us to define types that we wouldn't be allowed to if we didn't have
boxes.

18.1.1.1 Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes
............................................

A value of ‘recursive type’ can have another value of the same type as
part of itself.  Recursive types pose an issue because at compile time
Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up.  However, the nesting
of values of recursive types could theoretically continue infinitely, so
Rust can't know how much space the value needs.  Because boxes have a
known size, we can enable recursive types by inserting a box in the
recursive type definition.

As an example of a recursive type, let's explore the ‘cons list’.  This
is a data type commonly found in functional programming languages.  The
cons list type we'll define is straightforward except for the recursion;
therefore, the concepts in the example we'll work with will be useful
any time you get into more complex situations involving recursive types.
More Information About the Cons List A ‘cons list’ is a data structure
that comes from the Lisp programming language and its dialects and is
made up of nested pairs, and is the Lisp version of a linked list.  Its
name comes from the ‘cons’ function (short for “construct function”) in
Lisp that constructs a new pair from its two arguments.  By calling
‘cons’ on a pair consisting of a value and another pair, we can
construct cons lists made up of recursive pairs.

For example, here's a pseudocode representation of a cons list
containing the list 1, 2, 3 with each pair in parentheses:

(1, (2, (3, Nil)))

Each item in a cons list contains two elements: the value of the current
item and the next item.  The last item in the list contains only a value
called ‘Nil’ without a next item.  A cons list is produced by
recursively calling the ‘cons’ function.  The canonical name to denote
the base case of the recursion is ‘Nil’.  Note that this is not the same
as the “null” or “nil” concept in Chapter 6, which is an invalid or
absent value.

The cons list isn't a commonly used data structure in Rust.  Most of the
time when you have a list of items in Rust, ‘Vec<T>’ is a better choice
to use.  Other, more complex recursive data types ‘are’ useful in
various situations, but by starting with the cons list in this chapter,
we can explore how boxes let us define a recursive data type without
much distraction.

Listing 15-2 contains an enum definition for a cons list.  Note that
this code won't compile yet because the ‘List’ type doesn't have a known
size, which we'll demonstrate.

enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}

Note: We're implementing a cons list that holds only ‘i32’ values for
the purposes of this example.  We could have implemented it using
generics, as we discussed in Chapter 10, to define a cons list type that
could store values of any type.

Using the ‘List’ type to store the list ‘1, 2, 3’ would look like the
code in Listing 15-3:

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
}

The first ‘Cons’ value holds ‘1’ and another ‘List’ value.  This ‘List’
value is another ‘Cons’ value that holds ‘2’ and another ‘List’ value.
This ‘List’ value is one more ‘Cons’ value that holds ‘3’ and a ‘List’
value, which is finally ‘Nil’, the non-recursive variant that signals
the end of the list.

If we try to compile the code in Listing 15-3, we get the error shown in
Listing 15-4:

$ cargo run

error: could not compile `cons-list` (bin "cons-list") due to 2 previous errors

The error shows this type “has infinite size.” The reason is that we've
defined ‘List’ with a variant that is recursive: it holds another value
of itself directly.  As a result, Rust can't figure out how much space
it needs to store a ‘List’ value.  Let's break down why we get this
error.  First, we'll look at how Rust decides how much space it needs to
store a value of a non-recursive type.  Computing the Size of a
Non-Recursive Type Recall the ‘Message’ enum we defined in Listing 6-2
when we discussed enum definitions in Chapter 6:

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

To determine how much space to allocate for a ‘Message’ value, Rust goes
through each of the variants to see which variant needs the most space.
Rust sees that ‘Message::Quit’ doesn't need any space, ‘Message::Move’
needs enough space to store two ‘i32’ values, and so forth.  Because
only one variant will be used, the most space a ‘Message’ value will
need is the space it would take to store the largest of its variants.

Contrast this with what happens when Rust tries to determine how much
space a recursive type like the ‘List’ enum in Listing 15-2 needs.  The
compiler starts by looking at the ‘Cons’ variant, which holds a value of
type ‘i32’ and a value of type ‘List’.  Therefore, ‘Cons’ needs an
amount of space equal to the size of an ‘i32’ plus the size of a ‘List’.
To figure out how much memory the ‘List’ type needs, the compiler looks
at the variants, starting with the ‘Cons’ variant.  The ‘Cons’ variant
holds a value of type ‘i32’ and a value of type ‘List’, and this process
continues infinitely, as shown in Figure 15-1.

Figure 15-1: An infinite ‘List’ consisting of infinite ‘Cons’ variants
Using ‘Box<T>’ to Get a Recursive Type with a Known Size Because Rust
can't figure out how much space to allocate for recursively defined
types, the compiler gives an error with this helpful suggestion:

help: insert some indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) to break the cycle
  |
2 |     Cons(i32, Box<List>),
  |               ++++    +

In this suggestion, “indirection” means that instead of storing a value
directly, we should change the data structure to store the value
indirectly by storing a pointer to the value instead.

Because a ‘Box<T>’ is a pointer, Rust always knows how much space a
‘Box<T>’ needs: a pointer's size doesn't change based on the amount of
data it's pointing to.  This means we can put a ‘Box<T>’ inside the
‘Cons’ variant instead of another ‘List’ value directly.  The ‘Box<T>’
will point to the next ‘List’ value that will be on the heap rather than
inside the ‘Cons’ variant.  Conceptually, we still have a list, created
with lists holding other lists, but this implementation is now more like
placing the items next to one another rather than inside one another.

We can change the definition of the ‘List’ enum in Listing 15-2 and the
usage of the ‘List’ in Listing 15-3 to the code in Listing 15-5, which
will compile:

enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil))))));
}

The ‘Cons’ variant needs the size of an ‘i32’ plus the space to store
the box's pointer data.  The ‘Nil’ variant stores no values, so it needs
less space than the ‘Cons’ variant.  We now know that any ‘List’ value
will take up the size of an ‘i32’ plus the size of a box's pointer data.
By using a box, we've broken the infinite, recursive chain, so the
compiler can figure out the size it needs to store a ‘List’ value.
Figure 15-2 shows what the ‘Cons’ variant looks like now.

Figure 15-2: A ‘List’ that is not infinitely sized because ‘Cons’ holds
a ‘Box’

Boxes provide only the indirection and heap allocation; they don't have
any other special capabilities, like those we'll see with the other
smart pointer types.  They also don't have the performance overhead that
these special capabilities incur, so they can be useful in cases like
the cons list where the indirection is the only feature we need.  We'll
look at more use cases for boxes in Chapter 18, too.

The ‘Box<T>’ type is a smart pointer because it implements the ‘Deref’
trait, which allows ‘Box<T>’ values to be treated like references.  When
a ‘Box<T>’ value goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is
pointing to is cleaned up as well because of the ‘Drop’ trait
implementation.  These two traits will be even more important to the
functionality provided by the other smart pointer types we'll discuss in
the rest of this chapter.  Let's explore these two traits in more
detail.

18.1.2 Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the
---------------------------------------------------------------

‘Deref’ Trait Implementing the ‘Deref’ trait allows you to customize the
behavior of the ‘dereference operator’ ‘*’ (not to be confused with the
multiplication or glob operator).  By implementing ‘Deref’ in such a way
that a smart pointer can be treated like a regular reference, you can
write code that operates on references and use that code with smart
pointers too.

Let's first look at how the dereference operator works with regular
references.  Then we'll try to define a custom type that behaves like
‘Box<T>’, and see why the dereference operator doesn't work like a
reference on our newly defined type.  We'll explore how implementing the
‘Deref’ trait makes it possible for smart pointers to work in ways
similar to references.  Then we'll look at Rust's ‘deref coercion’
feature and how it lets us work with either references or smart
pointers.

Note: There's one big difference between the ‘MyBox<T>’ type we're about
to build and the real ‘Box<T>’: our version will not store its data on
the heap.  We are focusing this example on ‘Deref’, so where the data is
actually stored is less important than the pointer-like behavior.

18.1.2.1 Following the Pointer to the Value
...........................................

A regular reference is a type of pointer, and one way to think of a
pointer is as an arrow to a value stored somewhere else.  In Listing
15-6, we create a reference to an ‘i32’ value and then use the
dereference operator to follow the reference to the value:

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}

The variable ‘x’ holds an ‘i32’ value ‘5’.  We set ‘y’ equal to a
reference to ‘x’.  We can assert that ‘x’ is equal to ‘5’.  However, if
we want to make an assertion about the value in ‘y’, we have to use ‘*y’
to follow the reference to the value it's pointing to (hence
‘dereference’) so the compiler can compare the actual value.  Once we
dereference ‘y’, we have access to the integer value ‘y’ is pointing to
that we can compare with ‘5’.

If we tried to write ‘assert_eq!(5, y);’ instead, we would get this
compilation error:

Comparing a number and a reference to a number isn't allowed because
they're different types.  We must use the dereference operator to follow
the reference to the value it's pointing to.

18.1.2.2 Using ‘Box<T>’ Like a Reference
........................................

We can rewrite the code in Listing 15-6 to use a ‘Box<T>’ instead of a
reference; the dereference operator used on the ‘Box<T>’ in Listing 15-7
functions in the same way as the dereference operator used on the
reference in Listing 15-6:

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = Box::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}

The main difference between Listing 15-7 and Listing 15-6 is that here
we set ‘y’ to be an instance of a ‘Box<T>’ pointing to a copied value of
‘x’ rather than a reference pointing to the value of ‘x’.  In the last
assertion, we can use the dereference operator to follow the pointer of
the ‘Box<T>’ in the same way that we did when ‘y’ was a reference.
Next, we'll explore what is special about ‘Box<T>’ that enables us to
use the dereference operator by defining our own type.

18.1.2.3 Defining Our Own Smart Pointer
.......................................

Let's build a smart pointer similar to the ‘Box<T>’ type provided by the
standard library to experience how smart pointers behave differently
from references by default.  Then we'll look at how to add the ability
to use the dereference operator.

The ‘Box<T>’ type is ultimately defined as a tuple struct with one
element, so Listing 15-8 defines a ‘MyBox<T>’ type in the same way.
We'll also define a ‘new’ function to match the ‘new’ function defined
on ‘Box<T>’.

struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}

We define a struct named ‘MyBox’ and declare a generic parameter ‘T’,
because we want our type to hold values of any type.  The ‘MyBox’ type
is a tuple struct with one element of type ‘T’.  The ‘MyBox::new’
function takes one parameter of type ‘T’ and returns a ‘MyBox’ instance
that holds the value passed in.

Let's try adding the ‘main’ function in Listing 15-7 to Listing 15-8 and
changing it to use the ‘MyBox<T>’ type we've defined instead of
‘Box<T>’.  The code in Listing 15-9 won't compile because Rust doesn't
know how to dereference ‘MyBox’.

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = MyBox::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}

Here's the resulting compilation error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling deref-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/deref-example)

Our ‘MyBox<T>’ type can't be dereferenced because we haven't implemented
that ability on our type.  To enable dereferencing with the ‘*’
operator, we implement the ‘Deref’ trait.

18.1.2.4 Treating a Type Like a Reference by Implementing the
.............................................................

‘Deref’ Trait As discussed in the *note “Implementing a Trait on a
Type”: Implementing a Trait on a Type. section of Chapter 10, to
implement a trait, we need to provide implementations for the trait's
required methods.  The ‘Deref’ trait, provided by the standard library,
requires us to implement one method named ‘deref’ that borrows ‘self’
and returns a reference to the inner data.  Listing 15-10 contains an
implementation of ‘Deref’ to add to the definition of ‘MyBox’:

use std::ops::Deref;

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        &self.0
    }
}

The ‘type Target = T;’ syntax defines an associated type for the ‘Deref’
trait to use.  Associated types are a slightly different way of
declaring a generic parameter, but you don't need to worry about them
for now; we'll cover them in more detail in Chapter 20.

We fill in the body of the ‘deref’ method with ‘&self.0’ so ‘deref’
returns a reference to the value we want to access with the ‘*’
operator; recall from the *note “Using Tuple Structs without Named
Fields to Create Different Types”: Using Tuple Structs Without Named
Fields to Create Different Types. section of Chapter 5 that ‘.0’
accesses the first value in a tuple struct.  The ‘main’ function in
Listing 15-9 that calls ‘*’ on the ‘MyBox<T>’ value now compiles, and
the assertions pass!

Without the ‘Deref’ trait, the compiler can only dereference ‘&’
references.  The ‘deref’ method gives the compiler the ability to take a
value of any type that implements ‘Deref’ and call the ‘deref’ method to
get a ‘&’ reference that it knows how to dereference.

When we entered ‘*y’ in Listing 15-9, behind the scenes Rust actually
ran this code:

*(y.deref())

Rust substitutes the ‘*’ operator with a call to the ‘deref’ method and
then a plain dereference so we don't have to think about whether or not
we need to call the ‘deref’ method.  This Rust feature lets us write
code that functions identically whether we have a regular reference or a
type that implements ‘Deref’.

The reason the ‘deref’ method returns a reference to a value, and that
the plain dereference outside the parentheses in ‘*(y.deref())’ is still
necessary, is to do with the ownership system.  If the ‘deref’ method
returned the value directly instead of a reference to the value, the
value would be moved out of ‘self’.  We don't want to take ownership of
the inner value inside ‘MyBox<T>’ in this case or in most cases where we
use the dereference operator.

Note that the ‘*’ operator is replaced with a call to the ‘deref’ method
and then a call to the ‘*’ operator just once, each time we use a ‘*’ in
our code.  Because the substitution of the ‘*’ operator does not recurse
infinitely, we end up with data of type ‘i32’, which matches the ‘5’ in
‘assert_eq!’ in Listing 15-9.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods,  Next: How Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability,  Prev: Treating a Type Like a Reference by Implementing the Deref Trait,  Up: Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the Deref Trait

18.1.2.5 Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods
............................................................

‘Deref coercion’ converts a reference to a type that implements the
‘Deref’ trait into a reference to another type.  For example, deref
coercion can convert ‘&String’ to ‘&str’ because ‘String’ implements the
‘Deref’ trait such that it returns ‘&str’.  Deref coercion is a
convenience Rust performs on arguments to functions and methods, and
works only on types that implement the ‘Deref’ trait.  It happens
automatically when we pass a reference to a particular type's value as
an argument to a function or method that doesn't match the parameter
type in the function or method definition.  A sequence of calls to the
‘deref’ method converts the type we provided into the type the parameter
needs.

Deref coercion was added to Rust so that programmers writing function
and method calls don't need to add as many explicit references and
dereferences with ‘&’ and ‘*’.  The deref coercion feature also lets us
write more code that can work for either references or smart pointers.

To see deref coercion in action, let's use the ‘MyBox<T>’ type we
defined in Listing 15-8 as well as the implementation of ‘Deref’ that we
added in Listing 15-10.  Listing 15-11 shows the definition of a
function that has a string slice parameter:

fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {name}!");
}

We can call the ‘hello’ function with a string slice as an argument,
such as ‘hello("Rust");’ for example.  Deref coercion makes it possible
to call ‘hello’ with a reference to a value of type ‘MyBox<String>’, as
shown in Listing 15-12:

fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&m);
}

Here we're calling the ‘hello’ function with the argument ‘&m’, which is
a reference to a ‘MyBox<String>’ value.  Because we implemented the
‘Deref’ trait on ‘MyBox<T>’ in Listing 15-10, Rust can turn
‘&MyBox<String>’ into ‘&String’ by calling ‘deref’.  The standard
library provides an implementation of ‘Deref’ on ‘String’ that returns a
string slice, and this is in the API documentation for ‘Deref’.  Rust
calls ‘deref’ again to turn the ‘&String’ into ‘&str’, which matches the
‘hello’ function's definition.

If Rust didn't implement deref coercion, we would have to write the code
in Listing 15-13 instead of the code in Listing 15-12 to call ‘hello’
with a value of type ‘&MyBox<String>’.

fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&(*m)[..]);
}

The ‘(*m)’ dereferences the ‘MyBox<String>’ into a ‘String’.  Then the
‘&’ and ‘[..]’ take a string slice of the ‘String’ that is equal to the
whole string to match the signature of ‘hello’.  This code without deref
coercions is harder to read, write, and understand with all of these
symbols involved.  Deref coercion allows Rust to handle these
conversions for us automatically.

When the ‘Deref’ trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will
analyze the types and use ‘Deref::deref’ as many times as necessary to
get a reference to match the parameter's type.  The number of times that
‘Deref::deref’ needs to be inserted is resolved at compile time, so
there is no runtime penalty for taking advantage of deref coercion!

18.1.2.6 How Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability
.....................................................

Similar to how you use the ‘Deref’ trait to override the ‘*’ operator on
immutable references, you can use the ‘DerefMut’ trait to override the
‘*’ operator on mutable references.

Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations
in three cases:

   • From ‘&T’ to ‘&U’ when ‘T: Deref<Target=U>’
   • From ‘&mut T’ to ‘&mut U’ when ‘T: DerefMut<Target=U>’
   • From ‘&mut T’ to ‘&U’ when ‘T: Deref<Target=U>’

The first two cases are the same as each other except that the second
implements mutability.  The first case states that if you have a ‘&T’,
and ‘T’ implements ‘Deref’ to some type ‘U’, you can get a ‘&U’
transparently.  The second case states that the same deref coercion
happens for mutable references.

The third case is trickier: Rust will also coerce a mutable reference to
an immutable one.  But the reverse is ‘not’ possible: immutable
references will never coerce to mutable references.  Because of the
borrowing rules, if you have a mutable reference, that mutable reference
must be the only reference to that data (otherwise, the program wouldn't
compile).  Converting one mutable reference to one immutable reference
will never break the borrowing rules.  Converting an immutable reference
to a mutable reference would require that the initial immutable
reference is the only immutable reference to that data, but the
borrowing rules don't guarantee that.  Therefore, Rust can't make the
assumption that converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference
is possible.

18.1.3 Running Code on Cleanup with the ‘Drop’ Trait
----------------------------------------------------

The second trait important to the smart pointer pattern is ‘Drop’, which
lets you customize what happens when a value is about to go out of
scope.  You can provide an implementation for the ‘Drop’ trait on any
type, and that code can be used to release resources like files or
network connections.

We're introducing ‘Drop’ in the context of smart pointers because the
functionality of the ‘Drop’ trait is almost always used when
implementing a smart pointer.  For example, when a ‘Box<T>’ is dropped
it will deallocate the space on the heap that the box points to.

In some languages, for some types, the programmer must call code to free
memory or resources every time they finish using an instance of those
types.  Examples include file handles, sockets, or locks.  If they
forget, the system might become overloaded and crash.  In Rust, you can
specify that a particular bit of code be run whenever a value goes out
of scope, and the compiler will insert this code automatically.  As a
result, you don't need to be careful about placing cleanup code
everywhere in a program that an instance of a particular type is
finished with--you still won't leak resources!

You specify the code to run when a value goes out of scope by
implementing the ‘Drop’ trait.  The ‘Drop’ trait requires you to
implement one method named ‘drop’ that takes a mutable reference to
‘self’.  To see when Rust calls ‘drop’, let's implement ‘drop’ with
‘println!’ statements for now.

Listing 15-14 shows a ‘CustomSmartPointer’ struct whose only custom
functionality is that it will print ‘Dropping CustomSmartPointer!’ when
the instance goes out of scope, to show when Rust runs the ‘drop’
function.

struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`!", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("my stuff"),
    };
    let d = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("other stuff"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointers created.");
}

The ‘Drop’ trait is included in the prelude, so we don't need to bring
it into scope.  We implement the ‘Drop’ trait on ‘CustomSmartPointer’
and provide an implementation for the ‘drop’ method that calls
‘println!’.  The body of the ‘drop’ function is where you would place
any logic that you wanted to run when an instance of your type goes out
of scope.  We're printing some text here to demonstrate visually when
Rust will call ‘drop’.

In ‘main’, we create two instances of ‘CustomSmartPointer’ and then
print ‘CustomSmartPointers created’.  At the end of ‘main’, our
instances of ‘CustomSmartPointer’ will go out of scope, and Rust will
call the code we put in the ‘drop’ method, printing our final message.
Note that we didn't need to call the ‘drop’ method explicitly.

When we run this program, we'll see the following output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling drop-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/drop-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.60s
     Running `target/debug/drop-example`
CustomSmartPointers created.
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `other stuff`!
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `my stuff`!

Rust automatically called ‘drop’ for us when our instances went out of
scope, calling the code we specified.  Variables are dropped in the
reverse order of their creation, so ‘d’ was dropped before ‘c’.  This
example's purpose is to give you a visual guide to how the ‘drop’ method
works; usually you would specify the cleanup code that your type needs
to run rather than a print message.

18.1.3.1 Dropping a Value Early with ‘std::mem::drop’
.....................................................

Unfortunately, it's not straightforward to disable the automatic ‘drop’
functionality.  Disabling ‘drop’ isn't usually necessary; the whole
point of the ‘Drop’ trait is that it's taken care of automatically.
Occasionally, however, you might want to clean up a value early.  One
example is when using smart pointers that manage locks: you might want
to force the ‘drop’ method that releases the lock so that other code in
the same scope can acquire the lock.  Rust doesn't let you call the
‘Drop’ trait's ‘drop’ method manually; instead you have to call the
‘std::mem::drop’ function provided by the standard library if you want
to force a value to be dropped before the end of its scope.

If we try to call the ‘Drop’ trait's ‘drop’ method manually by modifying
the ‘main’ function from Listing 15-14, as shown in Listing 15-15, we'll
get a compiler error:

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("some data"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    c.drop();
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}

When we try to compile this code, we'll get this error:

This error message states that we're not allowed to explicitly call
‘drop’.  The error message uses the term ‘destructor’, which is the
general programming term for a function that cleans up an instance.  A
‘destructor’ is analogous to a ‘constructor’, which creates an instance.
The ‘drop’ function in Rust is one particular destructor.

Rust doesn't let us call ‘drop’ explicitly because Rust would still
automatically call ‘drop’ on the value at the end of ‘main’.  This would
cause a ‘double free’ error because Rust would be trying to clean up the
same value twice.

We can't disable the automatic insertion of ‘drop’ when a value goes out
of scope, and we can't call the ‘drop’ method explicitly.  So, if we
need to force a value to be cleaned up early, we use the
‘std::mem::drop’ function.

The ‘std::mem::drop’ function is different from the ‘drop’ method in the
‘Drop’ trait.  We call it by passing as an argument the value we want to
force drop.  The function is in the prelude, so we can modify ‘main’ in
Listing 15-15 to call the ‘drop’ function, as shown in Listing 15-16:

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("some data"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    drop(c);
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}

Running this code will print the following:

Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `some data`!
CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.

The text ‘Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `some data`!’ is printed
between the ‘CustomSmartPointer created.’ and ‘CustomSmartPointer
dropped before the end of main.’ text, showing that the ‘drop’ method
code is called to drop ‘c’ at that point.

You can use code specified in a ‘Drop’ trait implementation in many ways
to make cleanup convenient and safe: for instance, you could use it to
create your own memory allocator!  With the ‘Drop’ trait and Rust's
ownership system, you don't have to remember to clean up because Rust
does it automatically.

You also don't have to worry about problems resulting from accidentally
cleaning up values still in use: the ownership system that makes sure
references are always valid also ensures that ‘drop’ gets called only
once when the value is no longer being used.

Now that we've examined ‘Box<T>’ and some of the characteristics of
smart pointers, let's look at a few other smart pointers defined in the
standard library.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Rc<T> the Reference Counted Smart Pointer,  Next: RefCell<T> and the Interior Mutability Pattern,  Prev: Running Code on Cleanup with the Drop Trait,  Up: Smart Pointers

18.1.4 ‘Rc<T>’, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer
---------------------------------------------------

In the majority of cases, ownership is clear: you know exactly which
variable owns a given value.  However, there are cases when a single
value might have multiple owners.  For example, in graph data
structures, multiple edges might point to the same node, and that node
is conceptually owned by all of the edges that point to it.  A node
shouldn't be cleaned up unless it doesn't have any edges pointing to it
and so has no owners.

You have to enable multiple ownership explicitly by using the Rust type
‘Rc<T>’, which is an abbreviation for ‘reference counting’.  The ‘Rc<T>’
type keeps track of the number of references to a value to determine
whether or not the value is still in use.  If there are zero references
to a value, the value can be cleaned up without any references becoming
invalid.

Imagine ‘Rc<T>’ as a TV in a family room.  When one person enters to
watch TV, they turn it on.  Others can come into the room and watch the
TV. When the last person leaves the room, they turn off the TV because
it's no longer being used.  If someone turns off the TV while others are
still watching it, there would be uproar from the remaining TV watchers!

We use the ‘Rc<T>’ type when we want to allocate some data on the heap
for multiple parts of our program to read and we can't determine at
compile time which part will finish using the data last.  If we knew
which part would finish last, we could just make that part the data's
owner, and the normal ownership rules enforced at compile time would
take effect.

Note that ‘Rc<T>’ is only for use in single-threaded scenarios.  When we
discuss concurrency in Chapter 16, we'll cover how to do reference
counting in multithreaded programs.

18.1.4.1 Using ‘Rc<T>’ to Share Data
....................................

Let's return to our cons list example in Listing 15-5.  Recall that we
defined it using ‘Box<T>’.  This time, we'll create two lists that both
share ownership of a third list.  Conceptually, this looks similar to
Figure 15-3:

Figure 15-3: Two lists, ‘b’ and ‘c’, sharing ownership of a third list,
‘a’

We'll create list ‘a’ that contains 5 and then 10.  Then we'll make two
more lists: ‘b’ that starts with 3 and ‘c’ that starts with 4.  Both ‘b’
and ‘c’ lists will then continue on to the first ‘a’ list containing 5
and 10.  In other words, both lists will share the first list containing
5 and 10.

Trying to implement this scenario using our definition of ‘List’ with
‘Box<T>’ won't work, as shown in Listing 15-17:

enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let a = Cons(5, Box::new(Cons(10, Box::new(Nil))));
    let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
    let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
}

error: could not compile `cons-list` (bin "cons-list") due to 1 previous error

The ‘Cons’ variants own the data they hold, so when we create the ‘b’
list, ‘a’ is moved into ‘b’ and ‘b’ owns ‘a’.  Then, when we try to use
‘a’ again when creating ‘c’, we're not allowed to because ‘a’ has been
moved.

We could change the definition of ‘Cons’ to hold references instead, but
then we would have to specify lifetime parameters.  By specifying
lifetime parameters, we would be specifying that every element in the
list will live at least as long as the entire list.  This is the case
for the elements and lists in Listing 15-17, but not in every scenario.

Instead, we'll change our definition of ‘List’ to use ‘Rc<T>’ in place
of ‘Box<T>’, as shown in Listing 15-18.  Each ‘Cons’ variant will now
hold a value and an ‘Rc<T>’ pointing to a ‘List’.  When we create ‘b’,
instead of taking ownership of ‘a’, we'll clone the ‘Rc<List>’ that ‘a’
is holding, thereby increasing the number of references from one to two
and letting ‘a’ and ‘b’ share ownership of the data in that ‘Rc<List>’.
We'll also clone ‘a’ when creating ‘c’, increasing the number of
references from two to three.  Every time we call ‘Rc::clone’, the
reference count to the data within the ‘Rc<List>’ will increase, and the
data won't be cleaned up unless there are zero references to it.

enum List {
    Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}

We need to add a ‘use’ statement to bring ‘Rc<T>’ into scope because
it's not in the prelude.  In ‘main’, we create the list holding 5 and 10
and store it in a new ‘Rc<List>’ in ‘a’.  Then when we create ‘b’ and
‘c’, we call the ‘Rc::clone’ function and pass a reference to the
‘Rc<List>’ in ‘a’ as an argument.

We could have called ‘a.clone()’ rather than ‘Rc::clone(&a)’, but Rust's
convention is to use ‘Rc::clone’ in this case.  The implementation of
‘Rc::clone’ doesn't make a deep copy of all the data like most types'
implementations of ‘clone’ do.  The call to ‘Rc::clone’ only increments
the reference count, which doesn't take much time.  Deep copies of data
can take a lot of time.  By using ‘Rc::clone’ for reference counting, we
can visually distinguish between the deep-copy kinds of clones and the
kinds of clones that increase the reference count.  When looking for
performance problems in the code, we only need to consider the deep-copy
clones and can disregard calls to ‘Rc::clone’.

18.1.4.2 Cloning an ‘Rc<T>’ Increases the Reference Count
.........................................................

Let's change our working example in Listing 15-18 so we can see the
reference counts changing as we create and drop references to the
‘Rc<List>’ in ‘a’.

In Listing 15-19, we'll change ‘main’ so it has an inner scope around
list ‘c’; then we can see how the reference count changes when ‘c’ goes
out of scope.

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    println!("count after creating a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!("count after creating b = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!("count after creating c = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    }
    println!("count after c goes out of scope = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
}

At each point in the program where the reference count changes, we print
the reference count, which we get by calling the ‘Rc::strong_count’
function.  This function is named ‘strong_count’ rather than ‘count’
because the ‘Rc<T>’ type also has a ‘weak_count’; we'll see what
‘weak_count’ is used for in the *note “Preventing Reference Cycles
Turning an ‘Rc<T>’ into a ‘Weak<T>’”: Preventing Reference Cycles
Turning an Rc<T> into a Weak<T>. section.

This code prints the following:

$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45s
     Running `target/debug/cons-list`
count after creating a = 1
count after creating b = 2
count after creating c = 3
count after c goes out of scope = 2

We can see that the ‘Rc<List>’ in ‘a’ has an initial reference count of
1; then each time we call ‘clone’, the count goes up by 1.  When ‘c’
goes out of scope, the count goes down by 1.  We don't have to call a
function to decrease the reference count like we have to call
‘Rc::clone’ to increase the reference count: the implementation of the
‘Drop’ trait decreases the reference count automatically when an ‘Rc<T>’
value goes out of scope.

What we can't see in this example is that when ‘b’ and then ‘a’ go out
of scope at the end of ‘main’, the count is then 0, and the ‘Rc<List>’
is cleaned up completely.  Using ‘Rc<T>’ allows a single value to have
multiple owners, and the count ensures that the value remains valid as
long as any of the owners still exist.

Via immutable references, ‘Rc<T>’ allows you to share data between
multiple parts of your program for reading only.  If ‘Rc<T>’ allowed you
to have multiple mutable references too, you might violate one of the
borrowing rules discussed in Chapter 4: multiple mutable borrows to the
same place can cause data races and inconsistencies.  But being able to
mutate data is very useful!  In the next section, we'll discuss the
interior mutability pattern and the ‘RefCell<T>’ type that you can use
in conjunction with an ‘Rc<T>’ to work with this immutability
restriction.

18.1.5 ‘RefCell<T>’ and the Interior Mutability Pattern
-------------------------------------------------------

‘Interior mutability’ is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to
mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data;
normally, this action is disallowed by the borrowing rules.  To mutate
data, the pattern uses ‘unsafe’ code inside a data structure to bend
Rust's usual rules that govern mutation and borrowing.  Unsafe code
indicates to the compiler that we're checking the rules manually instead
of relying on the compiler to check them for us; we will discuss unsafe
code more in Chapter 20.

We can use types that use the interior mutability pattern only when we
can ensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even
though the compiler can't guarantee that.  The ‘unsafe’ code involved is
then wrapped in a safe API, and the outer type is still immutable.

Let's explore this concept by looking at the ‘RefCell<T>’ type that
follows the interior mutability pattern.

18.1.5.1 Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime with
..................................................

‘RefCell<T>’ Unlike ‘Rc<T>’, the ‘RefCell<T>’ type represents single
ownership over the data it holds.  So, what makes ‘RefCell<T>’ different
from a type like ‘Box<T>’?  Recall the borrowing rules you learned in
Chapter 4:

   • At any given time, you can have ‘either’ (but not both) one mutable
     reference or any number of immutable references.
   • References must always be valid.

With references and ‘Box<T>’, the borrowing rules' invariants are
enforced at compile time.  With ‘RefCell<T>’, these invariants are
enforced ‘at runtime’.  With references, if you break these rules,
you'll get a compiler error.  With ‘RefCell<T>’, if you break these
rules, your program will panic and exit.

The advantages of checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that
errors will be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no
impact on runtime performance because all the analysis is completed
beforehand.  For those reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile
time is the best choice in the majority of cases, which is why this is
Rust's default.

The advantage of checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that
certain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, where they would've been
disallowed by the compile-time checks.  Static analysis, like the Rust
compiler, is inherently conservative.  Some properties of code are
impossible to detect by analyzing the code: the most famous example is
the Halting Problem, which is beyond the scope of this book but is an
interesting topic to research.

Because some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can't be sure
the code complies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct
program; in this way, it's conservative.  If Rust accepted an incorrect
program, users wouldn't be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes.
However, if Rust rejects a correct program, the programmer will be
inconvenienced, but nothing catastrophic can occur.  The ‘RefCell<T>’
type is useful when you're sure your code follows the borrowing rules
but the compiler is unable to understand and guarantee that.

Similar to ‘Rc<T>’, ‘RefCell<T>’ is only for use in single-threaded
scenarios and will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in
a multithreaded context.  We'll talk about how to get the functionality
of ‘RefCell<T>’ in a multithreaded program in Chapter 16.

Here is a recap of the reasons to choose ‘Box<T>’, ‘Rc<T>’, or
‘RefCell<T>’:

   • ‘Rc<T>’ enables multiple owners of the same data; ‘Box<T>’ and
     ‘RefCell<T>’ have single owners.
   • ‘Box<T>’ allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile
     time; ‘Rc<T>’ allows only immutable borrows checked at compile
     time; ‘RefCell<T>’ allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at
     runtime.
   • Because ‘RefCell<T>’ allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you
     can mutate the value inside the ‘RefCell<T>’ even when the
     ‘RefCell<T>’ is immutable.

Mutating the value inside an immutable value is the ‘interior
mutability’ pattern.  Let's look at a situation in which interior
mutability is useful and examine how it's possible.

18.1.5.2 Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable
..............................................................

Value A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when you have an
immutable value, you can't borrow it mutably.  For example, this code
won't compile:

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &mut x;
}

If you tried to compile this code, you'd get the following error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling borrowing v0.1.0 (file:///projects/borrowing)

  |         +++

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0596`.
error: could not compile `borrowing` (bin "borrowing") due to 1 previous error

However, there are situations in which it would be useful for a value to
mutate itself in its methods but appear immutable to other code.  Code
outside the value's methods would not be able to mutate the value.
Using ‘RefCell<T>’ is one way to get the ability to have interior
mutability, but ‘RefCell<T>’ doesn't get around the borrowing rules
completely: the borrow checker in the compiler allows this interior
mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked at runtime instead.  If
you violate the rules, you'll get a ‘panic!’ instead of a compiler
error.

Let's work through a practical example where we can use ‘RefCell<T>’ to
mutate an immutable value and see why that is useful.  A Use Case for
Interior Mutability: Mock Objects Sometimes during testing a programmer
will use a type in place of another type, in order to observe particular
behavior and assert it's implemented correctly.  This placeholder type
is called a ‘test double’.  Think of it in the sense of a “stunt double”
in filmmaking, where a person steps in and substitutes for an actor to
do a particular tricky scene.  Test doubles stand in for other types
when we're running tests.  ‘Mock objects’ are specific types of test
doubles that record what happens during a test so you can assert that
the correct actions took place.

Rust doesn't have objects in the same sense as other languages have
objects, and Rust doesn't have mock object functionality built into the
standard library as some other languages do.  However, you can
definitely create a struct that will serve the same purposes as a mock
object.

Here's the scenario we'll test: we'll create a library that tracks a
value against a maximum value and sends messages based on how close to
the maximum value the current value is.  This library could be used to
keep track of a user's quota for the number of API calls they're allowed
to make, for example.

Our library will only provide the functionality of tracking how close to
the maximum a value is and what the messages should be at what times.
Applications that use our library will be expected to provide the
mechanism for sending the messages: the application could put a message
in the application, send an email, send a text message, or something
else.  The library doesn't need to know that detail.  All it needs is
something that implements a trait we'll provide called ‘Messenger’.
Listing 15-20 shows the library code:

pub trait Messenger {
    fn send(&self, msg: &str);
}

pub struct LimitTracker<'a, T: Messenger> {
    messenger: &'a T,
    value: usize,
    max: usize,
}

impl<'a, T> LimitTracker<'a, T>
where
    T: Messenger,
{
    pub fn new(messenger: &'a T, max: usize) -> LimitTracker<'a, T> {
        LimitTracker {
            messenger,
            value: 0,
            max,
        }
    }

    pub fn set_value(&mut self, value: usize) {
        self.value = value;

        let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;

        if percentage_of_max >= 1.0 {
            self.messenger.send("Error: You are over your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.9 {
            self.messenger
                .send("Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.75 {
            self.messenger
                .send("Warning: You've used up over 75% of your quota!");
        }
    }
}

One important part of this code is that the ‘Messenger’ trait has one
method called ‘send’ that takes an immutable reference to ‘self’ and the
text of the message.  This trait is the interface our mock object needs
to implement so that the mock can be used in the same way a real object
is.  The other important part is that we want to test the behavior of
the ‘set_value’ method on the ‘LimitTracker’.  We can change what we
pass in for the ‘value’ parameter, but ‘set_value’ doesn't return
anything for us to make assertions on.  We want to be able to say that
if we create a ‘LimitTracker’ with something that implements the
‘Messenger’ trait and a particular value for ‘max’, when we pass
different numbers for ‘value’, the messenger is told to send the
appropriate messages.

We need a mock object that, instead of sending an email or text message
when we call ‘send’, will only keep track of the messages it's told to
send.  We can create a new instance of the mock object, create a
‘LimitTracker’ that uses the mock object, call the ‘set_value’ method on
‘LimitTracker’, and then check that the mock object has the messages we
expect.  Listing 15-21 shows an attempt to implement a mock object to do
just that, but the borrow checker won't allow it:

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    struct MockMessenger {
        sent_messages: Vec<String>,
    }

    impl MockMessenger {
        fn new() -> MockMessenger {
            MockMessenger {
                sent_messages: vec![],
            }
        }
    }

    impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
        }
    }

    fn it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
        let mock_messenger = MockMessenger::new();
        let mut limit_tracker = LimitTracker::new(&mock_messenger, 100);

        limit_tracker.set_value(80);

        assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.len(), 1);
    }
}

This test code defines a ‘MockMessenger’ struct that has a
‘sent_messages’ field with a ‘Vec’ of ‘String’ values to keep track of
the messages it's told to send.  We also define an associated function
‘new’ to make it convenient to create new ‘MockMessenger’ values that
start with an empty list of messages.  We then implement the ‘Messenger’
trait for ‘MockMessenger’ so we can give a ‘MockMessenger’ to a
‘LimitTracker’.  In the definition of the ‘send’ method, we take the
message passed in as a parameter and store it in the ‘MockMessenger’
list of ‘sent_messages’.

In the test, we're testing what happens when the ‘LimitTracker’ is told
to set ‘value’ to something that is more than 75 percent of the ‘max’
value.  First, we create a new ‘MockMessenger’, which will start with an
empty list of messages.  Then we create a new ‘LimitTracker’ and give it
a reference to the new ‘MockMessenger’ and a ‘max’ value of 100.  We
call the ‘set_value’ method on the ‘LimitTracker’ with a value of 80,
which is more than 75 percent of 100.  Then we assert that the list of
messages that the ‘MockMessenger’ is keeping track of should now have
one message in it.

However, there's one problem with this test, as shown here:

$ cargo test

error: could not compile `limit-tracker` (lib test) due to 1 previous error

We can't modify the ‘MockMessenger’ to keep track of the messages,
because the ‘send’ method takes an immutable reference to ‘self’.  We
also can't take the suggestion from the error text to use ‘&mut self’ in
both the ‘impl’ method and the ‘trait’ definition.  We do not want to
change the ‘Messenger’ trait solely for the sake of testing.  Instead,
we need to find a way to make our test code work correctly with our
existing design.

This is a situation in which interior mutability can help!  We'll store
the ‘sent_messages’ within a ‘RefCell<T>’, and then the ‘send’ method
will be able to modify ‘sent_messages’ to store the messages we've seen.
Listing 15-22 shows what that looks like:

mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use std::cell::RefCell;

    struct MockMessenger {
        sent_messages: RefCell<Vec<String>>,
    }

    impl MockMessenger {
        fn new() -> MockMessenger {
            MockMessenger {
                sent_messages: RefCell::new(vec![]),
            }
        }
    }

    impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            self.sent_messages.borrow_mut().push(String::from(message));
        }
    }

    fn it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
        // --snip--

        assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.borrow().len(), 1);
    }
}

The ‘sent_messages’ field is now of type ‘RefCell<Vec<String>>’ instead
of ‘Vec<String>’.  In the ‘new’ function, we create a new
‘RefCell<Vec<String>>’ instance around the empty vector.

For the implementation of the ‘send’ method, the first parameter is
still an immutable borrow of ‘self’, which matches the trait definition.
We call ‘borrow_mut’ on the ‘RefCell<Vec<String>>’ in
‘self.sent_messages’ to get a mutable reference to the value inside the
‘RefCell<Vec<String>>’, which is the vector.  Then we can call ‘push’ on
the mutable reference to the vector to keep track of the messages sent
during the test.

The last change we have to make is in the assertion: to see how many
items are in the inner vector, we call ‘borrow’ on the
‘RefCell<Vec<String>>’ to get an immutable reference to the vector.

Now that you've seen how to use ‘RefCell<T>’, let's dig into how it
works!  Keeping Track of Borrows at Runtime with ‘RefCell<T>’ When
creating immutable and mutable references, we use the ‘&’ and ‘&mut’
syntax, respectively.  With ‘RefCell<T>’, we use the ‘borrow’ and
‘borrow_mut’ methods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to
‘RefCell<T>’.  The ‘borrow’ method returns the smart pointer type
‘Ref<T>’, and ‘borrow_mut’ returns the smart pointer type ‘RefMut<T>’.
Both types implement ‘Deref’, so we can treat them like regular
references.

The ‘RefCell<T>’ keeps track of how many ‘Ref<T>’ and ‘RefMut<T>’ smart
pointers are currently active.  Every time we call ‘borrow’, the
‘RefCell<T>’ increases its count of how many immutable borrows are
active.  When a ‘Ref<T>’ value goes out of scope, the count of immutable
borrows goes down by one.  Just like the compile-time borrowing rules,
‘RefCell<T>’ lets us have many immutable borrows or one mutable borrow
at any point in time.

If we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error
as we would with references, the implementation of ‘RefCell<T>’ will
panic at runtime.  Listing 15-23 shows a modification of the
implementation of ‘send’ in Listing 15-22.  We're deliberately trying to
create two mutable borrows active for the same scope to illustrate that
‘RefCell<T>’ prevents us from doing this at runtime.

    impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            let mut one_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();
            let mut two_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();

            one_borrow.push(String::from(message));
            two_borrow.push(String::from(message));
        }
    }

We create a variable ‘one_borrow’ for the ‘RefMut<T>’ smart pointer
returned from ‘borrow_mut’.  Then we create another mutable borrow in
the same way in the variable ‘two_borrow’.  This makes two mutable
references in the same scope, which isn't allowed.  When we run the
tests for our library, the code in Listing 15-23 will compile without
any errors, but the test will fail:

$ cargo test

Notice that the code panicked with the message ‘already borrowed:
BorrowMutError’.  This is how ‘RefCell<T>’ handles violations of the
borrowing rules at runtime.

Choosing to catch borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time,
as we've done here, means you'd potentially be finding mistakes in your
code later in the development process: possibly not until your code was
deployed to production.  Also, your code would incur a small runtime
performance penalty as a result of keeping track of the borrows at
runtime rather than compile time.  However, using ‘RefCell<T>’ makes it
possible to write a mock object that can modify itself to keep track of
the messages it has seen while you're using it in a context where only
immutable values are allowed.  You can use ‘RefCell<T>’ despite its
trade-offs to get more functionality than regular references provide.

‘Rc<T>’ and ‘RefCell<T>’ A common way to use ‘RefCell<T>’ is in
combination with ‘Rc<T>’.  Recall that ‘Rc<T>’ lets you have multiple
owners of some data, but it only gives immutable access to that data.
If you have an ‘Rc<T>’ that holds a ‘RefCell<T>’, you can get a value
that can have multiple owners ‘and’ that you can mutate!

For example, recall the cons list example in Listing 15-18 where we used
‘Rc<T>’ to allow multiple lists to share ownership of another list.
Because ‘Rc<T>’ holds only immutable values, we can't change any of the
values in the list once we've created them.  Let's add in ‘RefCell<T>’
to gain the ability to change the values in the lists.  Listing 15-24
shows that by using a ‘RefCell<T>’ in the ‘Cons’ definition, we can
modify the value stored in all the lists:

enum List {
    Cons(Rc<RefCell<i32>>, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let value = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));

    let a = Rc::new(Cons(Rc::clone(&value), Rc::new(Nil)));

    let b = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(3)), Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(4)), Rc::clone(&a));

    *value.borrow_mut() += 10;

    println!("a after = {a:?}");
    println!("b after = {b:?}");
    println!("c after = {c:?}");
}

We create a value that is an instance of ‘Rc<RefCell<i32>>’ and store it
in a variable named ‘value’ so we can access it directly later.  Then we
create a ‘List’ in ‘a’ with a ‘Cons’ variant that holds ‘value’.  We
need to clone ‘value’ so both ‘a’ and ‘value’ have ownership of the
inner ‘5’ value rather than transferring ownership from ‘value’ to ‘a’
or having ‘a’ borrow from ‘value’.

We wrap the list ‘a’ in an ‘Rc<T>’ so when we create lists ‘b’ and ‘c’,
they can both refer to ‘a’, which is what we did in Listing 15-18.

After we've created the lists in ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’, we want to add 10 to
the value in ‘value’.  We do this by calling ‘borrow_mut’ on ‘value’,
which uses the automatic dereferencing feature we discussed in Chapter 5
(see the section *note “Where's the ‘->’ Operator?”: Where's the ->
Operator?.) to dereference the ‘Rc<T>’ to the inner ‘RefCell<T>’ value.
The ‘borrow_mut’ method returns a ‘RefMut<T>’ smart pointer, and we use
the dereference operator on it and change the inner value.

When we print ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’, we can see that they all have the
modified value of 15 rather than 5:

$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.63s
     Running `target/debug/cons-list`
a after = Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil)
b after = Cons(RefCell { value: 3 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
c after = Cons(RefCell { value: 4 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))

This technique is pretty neat!  By using ‘RefCell<T>’, we have an
outwardly immutable ‘List’ value.  But we can use the methods on
‘RefCell<T>’ that provide access to its interior mutability so we can
modify our data when we need to.  The runtime checks of the borrowing
rules protect us from data races, and it's sometimes worth trading a bit
of speed for this flexibility in our data structures.  Note that
‘RefCell<T>’ does not work for multithreaded code!  ‘Mutex<T>’ is the
thread-safe version of ‘RefCell<T>’ and we'll discuss ‘Mutex<T>’ in
Chapter 16.

18.1.6 Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory
---------------------------------------

Rust's memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible,
to accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a
‘memory leak’).  Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust's
guarantees, meaning memory leaks are memory safe in Rust.  We can see
that Rust allows memory leaks by using ‘Rc<T>’ and ‘RefCell<T>’: it's
possible to create references where items refer to each other in a
cycle.  This creates memory leaks because the reference count of each
item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values will never be
dropped.

18.1.6.1 Creating a Reference Cycle
...................................

Let's look at how a reference cycle might happen and how to prevent it,
starting with the definition of the ‘List’ enum and a ‘tail’ method in
Listing 15-25:

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

enum List {
    Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),
    Nil,
}

impl List {
    fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {
        match self {
            Cons(_, item) => Some(item),
            Nil => None,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {}

We're using another variation of the ‘List’ definition from Listing
15-5.  The second element in the ‘Cons’ variant is now
‘RefCell<Rc<List>>’, meaning that instead of having the ability to
modify the ‘i32’ value as we did in Listing 15-24, we want to modify the
‘List’ value a ‘Cons’ variant is pointing to.  We're also adding a
‘tail’ method to make it convenient for us to access the second item if
we have a ‘Cons’ variant.

In Listing 15-26, we're adding a ‘main’ function that uses the
definitions in Listing 15-25.  This code creates a list in ‘a’ and a
list in ‘b’ that points to the list in ‘a’.  Then it modifies the list
in ‘a’ to point to ‘b’, creating a reference cycle.  There are
‘println!’ statements along the way to show what the reference counts
are at various points in this process.

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, RefCell::new(Rc::new(Nil))));

    println!("a initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());

    let b = Rc::new(Cons(10, RefCell::new(Rc::clone(&a))));

    println!("a rc count after b creation = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("b initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("b next item = {:?}", b.tail());

    if let Some(link) = a.tail() {
        *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);
    }

    println!("b rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("a rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));

    // Uncomment the next line to see that we have a cycle;
    // it will overflow the stack
    // println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
}

We create an ‘Rc<List>’ instance holding a ‘List’ value in the variable
‘a’ with an initial list of ‘5, Nil’.  We then create an ‘Rc<List>’
instance holding another ‘List’ value in the variable ‘b’ that contains
the value 10 and points to the list in ‘a’.

We modify ‘a’ so it points to ‘b’ instead of ‘Nil’, creating a cycle.
We do that by using the ‘tail’ method to get a reference to the
‘RefCell<Rc<List>>’ in ‘a’, which we put in the variable ‘link’.  Then
we use the ‘borrow_mut’ method on the ‘RefCell<Rc<List>>’ to change the
value inside from an ‘Rc<List>’ that holds a ‘Nil’ value to the
‘Rc<List>’ in ‘b’.

When we run this code, keeping the last ‘println!’ commented out for the
moment, we'll get this output:

$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.53s
     Running `target/debug/cons-list`
a initial rc count = 1
a next item = Some(RefCell { value: Nil })
a rc count after b creation = 2
b initial rc count = 1
b next item = Some(RefCell { value: Cons(5, RefCell { value: Nil }) })
b rc count after changing a = 2
a rc count after changing a = 2

The reference count of the ‘Rc<List>’ instances in both ‘a’ and ‘b’ are
2 after we change the list in ‘a’ to point to ‘b’.  At the end of
‘main’, Rust drops the variable ‘b’, which decreases the reference count
of the ‘b’ ‘Rc<List>’ instance from 2 to 1.  The memory that ‘Rc<List>’
has on the heap won't be dropped at this point, because its reference
count is 1, not 0.  Then Rust drops ‘a’, which decreases the reference
count of the ‘a’ ‘Rc<List>’ instance from 2 to 1 as well.  This
instance's memory can't be dropped either, because the other ‘Rc<List>’
instance still refers to it.  The memory allocated to the list will
remain uncollected forever.  To visualize this reference cycle, we've
created a diagram in Figure 15-4.

Figure 15-4: A reference cycle of lists ‘a’ and ‘b’ pointing to each
other

If you uncomment the last ‘println!’ and run the program, Rust will try
to print this cycle with ‘a’ pointing to ‘b’ pointing to ‘a’ and so
forth until it overflows the stack.

Compared to a real-world program, the consequences of creating a
reference cycle in this example aren't very dire: right after we create
the reference cycle, the program ends.  However, if a more complex
program allocated lots of memory in a cycle and held onto it for a long
time, the program would use more memory than it needed and might
overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of available memory.

Creating reference cycles is not easily done, but it's not impossible
either.  If you have ‘RefCell<T>’ values that contain ‘Rc<T>’ values or
similar nested combinations of types with interior mutability and
reference counting, you must ensure that you don't create cycles; you
can't rely on Rust to catch them.  Creating a reference cycle would be a
logic bug in your program that you should use automated tests, code
reviews, and other software development practices to minimize.

Another solution for avoiding reference cycles is reorganizing your data
structures so that some references express ownership and some references
don't.  As a result, you can have cycles made up of some ownership
relationships and some non-ownership relationships, and only the
ownership relationships affect whether or not a value can be dropped.
In Listing 15-25, we always want ‘Cons’ variants to own their list, so
reorganizing the data structure isn't possible.  Let's look at an
example using graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes to see when
non-ownership relationships are an appropriate way to prevent reference
cycles.

18.1.6.2 Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an ‘Rc<T>’ into
.............................................................

a ‘Weak<T>’ So far, we've demonstrated that calling ‘Rc::clone’
increases the ‘strong_count’ of an ‘Rc<T>’ instance, and an ‘Rc<T>’
instance is only cleaned up if its ‘strong_count’ is 0.  You can also
create a ‘weak reference’ to the value within an ‘Rc<T>’ instance by
calling ‘Rc::downgrade’ and passing a reference to the ‘Rc<T>’.  Strong
references are how you can share ownership of an ‘Rc<T>’ instance.  Weak
references don't express an ownership relationship, and their count
doesn't affect when an ‘Rc<T>’ instance is cleaned up.  They won't cause
a reference cycle because any cycle involving some weak references will
be broken once the strong reference count of values involved is 0.

When you call ‘Rc::downgrade’, you get a smart pointer of type
‘Weak<T>’.  Instead of increasing the ‘strong_count’ in the ‘Rc<T>’
instance by 1, calling ‘Rc::downgrade’ increases the ‘weak_count’ by 1.
The ‘Rc<T>’ type uses ‘weak_count’ to keep track of how many ‘Weak<T>’
references exist, similar to ‘strong_count’.  The difference is the
‘weak_count’ doesn't need to be 0 for the ‘Rc<T>’ instance to be cleaned
up.

Because the value that ‘Weak<T>’ references might have been dropped, to
do anything with the value that a ‘Weak<T>’ is pointing to, you must
make sure the value still exists.  Do this by calling the ‘upgrade’
method on a ‘Weak<T>’ instance, which will return an ‘Option<Rc<T>>’.
You'll get a result of ‘Some’ if the ‘Rc<T>’ value has not been dropped
yet and a result of ‘None’ if the ‘Rc<T>’ value has been dropped.
Because ‘upgrade’ returns an ‘Option<Rc<T>>’, Rust will ensure that the
‘Some’ case and the ‘None’ case are handled, and there won't be an
invalid pointer.

As an example, rather than using a list whose items know only about the
next item, we'll create a tree whose items know about their children
items ‘and’ their parent items.  Creating a Tree Data Structure: a
‘Node’ with Child Nodes To start, we'll build a tree with nodes that
know about their child nodes.  We'll create a struct named ‘Node’ that
holds its own ‘i32’ value as well as references to its children ‘Node’
values:

Filename: src/main.rs

use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

struct Node {
    value: i32,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

We want a ‘Node’ to own its children, and we want to share that
ownership with variables so we can access each ‘Node’ in the tree
directly.  To do this, we define the ‘Vec<T>’ items to be values of type
‘Rc<Node>’.  We also want to modify which nodes are children of another
node, so we have a ‘RefCell<T>’ in ‘children’ around the
‘Vec<Rc<Node>>’.

Next, we'll use our struct definition and create one ‘Node’ instance
named ‘leaf’ with the value 3 and no children, and another instance
named ‘branch’ with the value 5 and ‘leaf’ as one of its children, as
shown in Listing 15-27:

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
    });
}

We clone the ‘Rc<Node>’ in ‘leaf’ and store that in ‘branch’, meaning
the ‘Node’ in ‘leaf’ now has two owners: ‘leaf’ and ‘branch’.  We can
get from ‘branch’ to ‘leaf’ through ‘branch.children’, but there's no
way to get from ‘leaf’ to ‘branch’.  The reason is that ‘leaf’ has no
reference to ‘branch’ and doesn't know they're related.  We want ‘leaf’
to know that ‘branch’ is its parent.  We'll do that next.  Adding a
Reference from a Child to Its Parent To make the child node aware of its
parent, we need to add a ‘parent’ field to our ‘Node’ struct definition.
The trouble is in deciding what the type of ‘parent’ should be.  We know
it can't contain an ‘Rc<T>’, because that would create a reference cycle
with ‘leaf.parent’ pointing to ‘branch’ and ‘branch.children’ pointing
to ‘leaf’, which would cause their ‘strong_count’ values to never be 0.

Thinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own
its children: if a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be
dropped as well.  However, a child should not own its parent: if we drop
a child node, the parent should still exist.  This is a case for weak
references!

So instead of ‘Rc<T>’, we'll make the type of ‘parent’ use ‘Weak<T>’,
specifically a ‘RefCell<Weak<Node>>’.  Now our ‘Node’ struct definition
looks like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

struct Node {
    value: i32,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

A node will be able to refer to its parent node but doesn't own its
parent.  In Listing 15-28, we update ‘main’ to use this new definition
so the ‘leaf’ node will have a way to refer to its parent, ‘branch’:

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());

    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
    });

    *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
}

Creating the ‘leaf’ node looks similar to Listing 15-27 with the
exception of the ‘parent’ field: ‘leaf’ starts out without a parent, so
we create a new, empty ‘Weak<Node>’ reference instance.

At this point, when we try to get a reference to the parent of ‘leaf’ by
using the ‘upgrade’ method, we get a ‘None’ value.  We see this in the
output from the first ‘println!’ statement:

leaf parent = None

When we create the ‘branch’ node, it will also have a new ‘Weak<Node>’
reference in the ‘parent’ field, because ‘branch’ doesn't have a parent
node.  We still have ‘leaf’ as one of the children of ‘branch’.  Once we
have the ‘Node’ instance in ‘branch’, we can modify ‘leaf’ to give it a
‘Weak<Node>’ reference to its parent.  We use the ‘borrow_mut’ method on
the ‘RefCell<Weak<Node>>’ in the ‘parent’ field of ‘leaf’, and then we
use the ‘Rc::downgrade’ function to create a ‘Weak<Node>’ reference to
‘branch’ from the ‘Rc<Node>’ in ‘branch.’

When we print the parent of ‘leaf’ again, this time we'll get a ‘Some’
variant holding ‘branch’: now ‘leaf’ can access its parent!  When we
print ‘leaf’, we also avoid the cycle that eventually ended in a stack
overflow like we had in Listing 15-26; the ‘Weak<Node>’ references are
printed as ‘(Weak)’:

leaf parent = Some(Node { value: 5, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },
children: RefCell { value: [Node { value: 3, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },
children: RefCell { value: [] } }] } })

The lack of infinite output indicates that this code didn't create a
reference cycle.  We can also tell this by looking at the values we get
from calling ‘Rc::strong_count’ and ‘Rc::weak_count’.  Visualizing
Changes to ‘strong_count’ and ‘weak_count’ Let's look at how the
‘strong_count’ and ‘weak_count’ values of the ‘Rc<Node>’ instances
change by creating a new inner scope and moving the creation of ‘branch’
into that scope.  By doing so, we can see what happens when ‘branch’ is
created and then dropped when it goes out of scope.  The modifications
are shown in Listing 15-29:

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    );

    {
        let branch = Rc::new(Node {
            value: 5,
            parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
            children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
        });

        *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

        println!(
            "branch strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&branch),
            Rc::weak_count(&branch),
        );

        println!(
            "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
            Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
        );
    }

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    );
}

After ‘leaf’ is created, its ‘Rc<Node>’ has a strong count of 1 and a
weak count of 0.  In the inner scope, we create ‘branch’ and associate
it with ‘leaf’, at which point when we print the counts, the ‘Rc<Node>’
in ‘branch’ will have a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 1 (for
‘leaf.parent’ pointing to ‘branch’ with a ‘Weak<Node>’).  When we print
the counts in ‘leaf’, we'll see it will have a strong count of 2,
because ‘branch’ now has a clone of the ‘Rc<Node>’ of ‘leaf’ stored in
‘branch.children’, but will still have a weak count of 0.

When the inner scope ends, ‘branch’ goes out of scope and the strong
count of the ‘Rc<Node>’ decreases to 0, so its ‘Node’ is dropped.  The
weak count of 1 from ‘leaf.parent’ has no bearing on whether or not
‘Node’ is dropped, so we don't get any memory leaks!

If we try to access the parent of ‘leaf’ after the end of the scope,
we'll get ‘None’ again.  At the end of the program, the ‘Rc<Node>’ in
‘leaf’ has a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 0, because the
variable ‘leaf’ is now the only reference to the ‘Rc<Node>’ again.

All of the logic that manages the counts and value dropping is built
into ‘Rc<T>’ and ‘Weak<T>’ and their implementations of the ‘Drop’
trait.  By specifying that the relationship from a child to its parent
should be a ‘Weak<T>’ reference in the definition of ‘Node’, you're able
to have parent nodes point to child nodes and vice versa without
creating a reference cycle and memory leaks.

18.1.7 Summary
--------------

This chapter covered how to use smart pointers to make different
guarantees and trade-offs from those Rust makes by default with regular
references.  The ‘Box<T>’ type has a known size and points to data
allocated on the heap.  The ‘Rc<T>’ type keeps track of the number of
references to data on the heap so that data can have multiple owners.
The ‘RefCell<T>’ type with its interior mutability gives us a type that
we can use when we need an immutable type but need to change an inner
value of that type; it also enforces the borrowing rules at runtime
instead of at compile time.

Also discussed were the ‘Deref’ and ‘Drop’ traits, which enable a lot of
the functionality of smart pointers.  We explored reference cycles that
can cause memory leaks and how to prevent them using ‘Weak<T>’.

If this chapter has piqued your interest and you want to implement your
own smart pointers, check out “The Rustonomicon”
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../nomicon/index.html) for more useful
information.

Next, we'll talk about concurrency in Rust.  You'll even learn about a
few new smart pointers.

19 Fearless Concurrency
***********************

Handling concurrent programming safely and efficiently is another of
Rust's major goals.  ‘Concurrent programming’, where different parts of
a program execute independently, and ‘parallel programming’, where
different parts of a program execute at the same time, are becoming
increasingly important as more computers take advantage of their
multiple processors.  Historically, programming in these contexts has
been difficult and error prone: Rust hopes to change that.

Initially, the Rust team thought that ensuring memory safety and
preventing concurrency problems were two separate challenges to be
solved with different methods.  Over time, the team discovered that the
ownership and type systems are a powerful set of tools to help manage
memory safety ‘and’ concurrency problems!  By leveraging ownership and
type checking, many concurrency errors are compile-time errors in Rust
rather than runtime errors.  Therefore, rather than making you spend
lots of time trying to reproduce the exact circumstances under which a
runtime concurrency bug occurs, incorrect code will refuse to compile
and present an error explaining the problem.  As a result, you can fix
your code while you're working on it rather than potentially after it
has been shipped to production.  We've nicknamed this aspect of Rust
‘fearless’ ‘concurrency’.  Fearless concurrency allows you to write code
that is free of subtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing
new bugs.

Note: For simplicity's sake, we'll refer to many of the problems as
‘concurrent’ rather than being more precise by saying ‘concurrent and/or
parallel’.  If this book were about concurrency and/or parallelism, we'd
be more specific.  For this chapter, please mentally substitute
‘concurrent and/or parallel’ whenever we use ‘concurrent’.

Many languages are dogmatic about the solutions they offer for handling
concurrent problems.  For example, Erlang has elegant functionality for
message-passing concurrency but has only obscure ways to share state
between threads.  Supporting only a subset of possible solutions is a
reasonable strategy for higher-level languages, because a higher-level
language promises benefits from giving up some control to gain
abstractions.  However, lower-level languages are expected to provide
the solution with the best performance in any given situation and have
fewer abstractions over the hardware.  Therefore, Rust offers a variety
of tools for modeling problems in whatever way is appropriate for your
situation and requirements.

Here are the topics we'll cover in this chapter:

   • How to create threads to run multiple pieces of code at the same
     time
   • ‘Message-passing’ concurrency, where channels send messages between
     threads
   • ‘Shared-state’ concurrency, where multiple threads have access to
     some piece of data
   • The ‘Sync’ and ‘Send’ traits, which extend Rust's concurrency
     guarantees to user-defined types as well as types provided by the
     standard library

19.1 Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously
=============================================

In most current operating systems, an executed program's code is run in
a ‘process’, and the operating system will manage multiple processes at
once.  Within a program, you can also have independent parts that run
simultaneously.  The features that run these independent parts are
called ‘threads’.  For example, a web server could have multiple threads
so that it could respond to more than one request at the same time.

Splitting the computation in your program into multiple threads to run
multiple tasks at the same time can improve performance, but it also
adds complexity.  Because threads can run simultaneously, there's no
inherent guarantee about the order in which parts of your code on
different threads will run.  This can lead to problems, such as:

   • Race conditions, where threads are accessing data or resources in
     an inconsistent order
   • Deadlocks, where two threads are waiting for each other, preventing
     both threads from continuing
   • Bugs that happen only in certain situations and are hard to
     reproduce and fix reliably

Rust attempts to mitigate the negative effects of using threads, but
programming in a multithreaded context still takes careful thought and
requires a code structure that is different from that in programs
running in a single thread.

Programming languages implement threads in a few different ways, and
many operating systems provide an API the language can call for creating
new threads.  The Rust standard library uses a ‘1:1’ model of thread
implementation, whereby a program uses one operating system thread per
one language thread.  There are crates that implement other models of
threading that make different tradeoffs to the 1:1 model.  (Rust's async
system, which we will see in the next chapter, provides another approach
to concurrency as well.)

19.1.1 Creating a New Thread with ‘spawn’
-----------------------------------------

To create a new thread, we call the ‘thread::spawn’ function and pass it
a closure (we talked about closures in Chapter 13) containing the code
we want to run in the new thread.  The example in Listing 16-1 prints
some text from a main thread and other text from a new thread:

use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {i} from the spawned thread!");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {i} from the main thread!");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}

Note that when the main thread of a Rust program completes, all spawned
threads are shut down, whether or not they have finished running.  The
output from this program might be a little different every time, but it
will look similar to the following:

hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!

The calls to ‘thread::sleep’ force a thread to stop its execution for a
short duration, allowing a different thread to run.  The threads will
probably take turns, but that isn't guaranteed: it depends on how your
operating system schedules the threads.  In this run, the main thread
printed first, even though the print statement from the spawned thread
appears first in the code.  And even though we told the spawned thread
to print until ‘i’ is 9, it only got to 5 before the main thread shut
down.

If you run this code and only see output from the main thread, or don't
see any overlap, try increasing the numbers in the ranges to create more
opportunities for the operating system to switch between the threads.

19.1.1.1 Waiting for All Threads to Finish Using ‘join’
.......................................................

Handles The code in Listing 16-1 not only stops the spawned thread
prematurely most of the time due to the main thread ending, but because
there is no guarantee on the order in which threads run, we also can't
guarantee that the spawned thread will get to run at all!

We can fix the problem of the spawned thread not running or ending
prematurely by saving the return value of ‘thread::spawn’ in a variable.
The return type of ‘thread::spawn’ is ‘JoinHandle’.  A ‘JoinHandle’ is
an owned value that, when we call the ‘join’ method on it, will wait for
its thread to finish.  Listing 16-2 shows how to use the ‘JoinHandle’ of
the thread we created in Listing 16-1 and call ‘join’ to make sure the
spawned thread finishes before ‘main’ exits:

use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {i} from the spawned thread!");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {i} from the main thread!");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}

Calling ‘join’ on the handle blocks the thread currently running until
the thread represented by the handle terminates.  ‘Blocking’ a thread
means that thread is prevented from performing work or exiting.  Because
we've put the call to ‘join’ after the main thread's ‘for’ loop, running
Listing 16-2 should produce output similar to this:

hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
hi number 6 from the spawned thread!
hi number 7 from the spawned thread!
hi number 8 from the spawned thread!
hi number 9 from the spawned thread!

The two threads continue alternating, but the main thread waits because
of the call to ‘handle.join()’ and does not end until the spawned thread
is finished.

But let's see what happens when we instead move ‘handle.join()’ before
the ‘for’ loop in ‘main’, like this:

use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {i} from the spawned thread!");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {i} from the main thread!");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}

The main thread will wait for the spawned thread to finish and then run
its ‘for’ loop, so the output won't be interleaved anymore, as shown
here:

hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
hi number 6 from the spawned thread!
hi number 7 from the spawned thread!
hi number 8 from the spawned thread!
hi number 9 from the spawned thread!
hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!

Small details, such as where ‘join’ is called, can affect whether or not
your threads run at the same time.

19.1.1.2 Using ‘move’ Closures with Threads
...........................................

We'll often use the ‘move’ keyword with closures passed to
‘thread::spawn’ because the closure will then take ownership of the
values it uses from the environment, thus transferring ownership of
those values from one thread to another.  In the *note “Capturing
References or Moving Ownership”: Capturing References or Moving
Ownership. section of Chapter 13, we discussed ‘move’ in the context of
closures.  Now, we'll concentrate more on the interaction between ‘move’
and ‘thread::spawn’.

Notice in Listing 16-1 that the closure we pass to ‘thread::spawn’ takes
no arguments: we're not using any data from the main thread in the
spawned thread's code.  To use data from the main thread in the spawned
thread, the spawned thread's closure must capture the values it needs.
Listing 16-3 shows an attempt to create a vector in the main thread and
use it in the spawned thread.  However, this won't yet work, as you'll
see in a moment.

use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("Here's a vector: {v:?}");
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}

The closure uses ‘v’, so it will capture ‘v’ and make it part of the
closure's environment.  Because ‘thread::spawn’ runs this closure in a
new thread, we should be able to access ‘v’ inside that new thread.  But
when we compile this example, we get the following error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling threads v0.1.0 (file:///projects/threads)

error: could not compile `threads` (bin "threads") due to 1 previous error

Rust ‘infers’ how to capture ‘v’, and because ‘println!’ only needs a
reference to ‘v’, the closure tries to borrow ‘v’.  However, there's a
problem: Rust can't tell how long the spawned thread will run, so it
doesn't know if the reference to ‘v’ will always be valid.

Listing 16-4 provides a scenario that's more likely to have a reference
to ‘v’ that won't be valid:

use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("Here's a vector: {v:?}");
    });

    drop(v); // oh no!

    handle.join().unwrap();
}

If Rust allowed us to run this code, there's a possibility the spawned
thread would be immediately put in the background without running at
all.  The spawned thread has a reference to ‘v’ inside, but the main
thread immediately drops ‘v’, using the ‘drop’ function we discussed in
Chapter 15.  Then, when the spawned thread starts to execute, ‘v’ is no
longer valid, so a reference to it is also invalid.  Oh no!

To fix the compiler error in Listing 16-3, we can use the error
message's advice:

help: to force the closure to take ownership of `v` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
  |
6 |     let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
  |                                ++++

By adding the ‘move’ keyword before the closure, we force the closure to
take ownership of the values it's using rather than allowing Rust to
infer that it should borrow the values.  The modification to Listing
16-3 shown in Listing 16-5 will compile and run as we intend:

use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("Here's a vector: {v:?}");
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}

We might be tempted to try the same thing to fix the code in Listing
16-4 where the main thread called ‘drop’ by using a ‘move’ closure.
However, this fix will not work because what Listing 16-4 is trying to
do is disallowed for a different reason.  If we added ‘move’ to the
closure, we would move ‘v’ into the closure's environment, and we could
no longer call ‘drop’ on it in the main thread.  We would get this
compiler error instead:

$ cargo run
   Compiling threads v0.1.0 (file:///projects/threads)

Rust's ownership rules have saved us again!  We got an error from the
code in Listing 16-3 because Rust was being conservative and only
borrowing ‘v’ for the thread, which meant the main thread could
theoretically invalidate the spawned thread's reference.  By telling
Rust to move ownership of ‘v’ to the spawned thread, we're guaranteeing
Rust that the main thread won't use ‘v’ anymore.  If we change Listing
16-4 in the same way, we're then violating the ownership rules when we
try to use ‘v’ in the main thread.  The ‘move’ keyword overrides Rust's
conservative default of borrowing; it doesn't let us violate the
ownership rules.

With a basic understanding of threads and the thread API, let's look at
what we can ‘do’ with threads.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Using Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads,  Next: Shared-State Concurrency,  Prev: Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously,  Up: Fearless Concurrency

19.1.2 Using Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads
-------------------------------------------------------------

One increasingly popular approach to ensuring safe concurrency is
‘message passing’, where threads or actors communicate by sending each
other messages containing data.  Here's the idea in a slogan from the Go
language documentation
(https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency): “Do not
communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.”

To accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rust's standard library
provides an implementation of ‘channels’.  A channel is a general
programming concept by which data is sent from one thread to another.

You can imagine a channel in programming as being like a directional
channel of water, such as a stream or a river.  If you put something
like a rubber duck into a river, it will travel downstream to the end of
the waterway.

A channel has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver.  The transmitter
half is the upstream location where you put rubber ducks into the river,
and the receiver half is where the rubber duck ends up downstream.  One
part of your code calls methods on the transmitter with the data you
want to send, and another part checks the receiving end for arriving
messages.  A channel is said to be ‘closed’ if either the transmitter or
receiver half is dropped.

Here, we'll work up to a program that has one thread to generate values
and send them down a channel, and another thread that will receive the
values and print them out.  We'll be sending simple values between
threads using a channel to illustrate the feature.  Once you're familiar
with the technique, you could use channels for any threads that need to
communicate between each other, such as a chat system or a system where
many threads perform parts of a calculation and send the parts to one
thread that aggregates the results.

First, in Listing 16-6, we'll create a channel but not do anything with
it.  Note that this won't compile yet because Rust can't tell what type
of values we want to send over the channel.

Filename: src/main.rs

use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
}

Listing 16-6: Creating a channel and assigning the two halves to ‘tx’
and ‘rx’

We create a new channel using the ‘mpsc::channel’ function; ‘mpsc’
stands for ‘multiple producer, single consumer’.  In short, the way
Rust's standard library implements channels means a channel can have
multiple ‘sending’ ends that produce values but only one ‘receiving’ end
that consumes those values.  Imagine multiple streams flowing together
into one big river: everything sent down any of the streams will end up
in one river at the end.  We'll start with a single producer for now,
but we'll add multiple producers when we get this example working.

The ‘mpsc::channel’ function returns a tuple, the first element of which
is the sending end--the transmitter--and the second element is the
receiving end--the receiver.  The abbreviations ‘tx’ and ‘rx’ are
traditionally used in many fields for ‘transmitter’ and ‘receiver’
respectively, so we name our variables as such to indicate each end.
We're using a ‘let’ statement with a pattern that destructures the
tuples; we'll discuss the use of patterns in ‘let’ statements and
destructuring in Chapter 19.  For now, know that using a ‘let’ statement
this way is a convenient approach to extract the pieces of the tuple
returned by ‘mpsc::channel’.

Let's move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send
one string so the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread,
as shown in Listing 16-7.  This is like putting a rubber duck in the
river upstream or sending a chat message from one thread to another.

use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });
}

Again, we're using ‘thread::spawn’ to create a new thread and then using
‘move’ to move ‘tx’ into the closure so the spawned thread owns ‘tx’.
The spawned thread needs to own the transmitter to be able to send
messages through the channel.  The transmitter has a ‘send’ method that
takes the value we want to send.  The ‘send’ method returns a ‘Result<T,
E>’ type, so if the receiver has already been dropped and there's
nowhere to send a value, the send operation will return an error.  In
this example, we're calling ‘unwrap’ to panic in case of an error.  But
in a real application, we would handle it properly: return to Chapter 9
to review strategies for proper error handling.

In Listing 16-8, we'll get the value from the receiver in the main
thread.  This is like retrieving the rubber duck from the water at the
end of the river or receiving a chat message.

use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Got: {received}");
}

The receiver has two useful methods: ‘recv’ and ‘try_recv’.  We're using
‘recv’, short for ‘receive’, which will block the main thread's
execution and wait until a value is sent down the channel.  Once a value
is sent, ‘recv’ will return it in a ‘Result<T, E>’.  When the
transmitter closes, ‘recv’ will return an error to signal that no more
values will be coming.

The ‘try_recv’ method doesn't block, but will instead return a
‘Result<T, E>’ immediately: an ‘Ok’ value holding a message if one is
available and an ‘Err’ value if there aren't any messages this time.
Using ‘try_recv’ is useful if this thread has other work to do while
waiting for messages: we could write a loop that calls ‘try_recv’ every
so often, handles a message if one is available, and otherwise does
other work for a little while until checking again.

We've used ‘recv’ in this example for simplicity; we don't have any
other work for the main thread to do other than wait for messages, so
blocking the main thread is appropriate.

When we run the code in Listing 16-8, we'll see the value printed from
the main thread:

Got: hi

Perfect!

19.1.2.1 Channels and Ownership Transference
............................................

The ownership rules play a vital role in message sending because they
help you write safe, concurrent code.  Preventing errors in concurrent
programming is the advantage of thinking about ownership throughout your
Rust programs.  Let's do an experiment to show how channels and
ownership work together to prevent problems: we'll try to use a ‘val’
value in the spawned thread ‘after’ we've sent it down the channel.  Try
compiling the code in Listing 16-9 to see why this code isn't allowed:

use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
        println!("val is {val}");
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Got: {received}");
}

Here, we try to print ‘val’ after we've sent it down the channel via
‘tx.send’.  Allowing this would be a bad idea: once the value has been
sent to another thread, that thread could modify or drop it before we
try to use the value again.  Potentially, the other thread's
modifications could cause errors or unexpected results due to
inconsistent or nonexistent data.  However, Rust gives us an error if we
try to compile the code in Listing 16-9:

error: could not compile `message-passing` (bin "message-passing") due to 1 previous error

Our concurrency mistake has caused a compile time error.  The ‘send’
function takes ownership of its parameter, and when the value is moved,
the receiver takes ownership of it.  This stops us from accidentally
using the value again after sending it; the ownership system checks that
everything is okay.

19.1.2.2 Sending Multiple Values and Seeing the Receiver Waiting
................................................................

The code in Listing 16-8 compiled and ran, but it didn't clearly show us
that two separate threads were talking to each other over the channel.
In Listing 16-10 we've made some modifications that will prove the code
in Listing 16-8 is running concurrently: the spawned thread will now
send multiple messages and pause for a second between each message.

use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("hi"),
            String::from("from"),
            String::from("the"),
            String::from("thread"),
        ];

        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {received}");
    }
}

This time, the spawned thread has a vector of strings that we want to
send to the main thread.  We iterate over them, sending each
individually, and pause between each by calling the ‘thread::sleep’
function with a ‘Duration’ value of 1 second.

In the main thread, we're not calling the ‘recv’ function explicitly
anymore: instead, we're treating ‘rx’ as an iterator.  For each value
received, we're printing it.  When the channel is closed, iteration will
end.

When running the code in Listing 16-10, you should see the following
output with a 1-second pause in between each line:

Got: hi
Got: from
Got: the
Got: thread

Because we don't have any code that pauses or delays in the ‘for’ loop
in the main thread, we can tell that the main thread is waiting to
receive values from the spawned thread.

19.1.2.3 Creating Multiple Producers by Cloning the Transmitter
...............................................................

Earlier we mentioned that ‘mpsc’ was an acronym for ‘multiple producer,
single consumer’.  Let's put ‘mpsc’ to use and expand the code in
Listing 16-10 to create multiple threads that all send values to the
same receiver.  We can do so by cloning the transmitter, as shown in
Listing 16-11:

    // --snip--

    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    let tx1 = tx.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("hi"),
            String::from("from"),
            String::from("the"),
            String::from("thread"),
        ];

        for val in vals {
            tx1.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("more"),
            String::from("messages"),
            String::from("for"),
            String::from("you"),
        ];

        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {received}");
    }

    // --snip--

This time, before we create the first spawned thread, we call ‘clone’ on
the transmitter.  This will give us a new transmitter we can pass to the
first spawned thread.  We pass the original transmitter to a second
spawned thread.  This gives us two threads, each sending different
messages to the one receiver.

When you run the code, your output should look something like this:

Got: hi
Got: more
Got: from
Got: messages
Got: for
Got: the
Got: thread
Got: you

You might see the values in another order, depending on your system.
This is what makes concurrency interesting as well as difficult.  If you
experiment with ‘thread::sleep’, giving it various values in the
different threads, each run will be more nondeterministic and create
different output each time.

Now that we've looked at how channels work, let's look at a different
method of concurrency.

19.1.3 Shared-State Concurrency
-------------------------------

Message passing is a fine way of handling concurrency, but it's not the
only one.  Another method would be for multiple threads to access the
same shared data.  Consider this part of the slogan from the Go language
documentation again: “do not communicate by sharing memory.”

What would communicating by sharing memory look like?  In addition, why
would message-passing enthusiasts caution not to use memory sharing?

In a way, channels in any programming language are similar to single
ownership, because once you transfer a value down a channel, you should
no longer use that value.  Shared memory concurrency is like multiple
ownership: multiple threads can access the same memory location at the
same time.  As you saw in Chapter 15, where smart pointers made multiple
ownership possible, multiple ownership can add complexity because these
different owners need managing.  Rust's type system and ownership rules
greatly assist in getting this management correct.  For an example,
let's look at mutexes, one of the more common concurrency primitives for
shared memory.

* Similarities Between RefCell<T>/Rc<T> and Mutex<T>/Arc<T>::

19.1.3.1 Using Mutexes to Allow Access to Data from One Thread at
.................................................................

a Time ‘Mutex’ is an abbreviation for ‘mutual exclusion’, as in, a mutex
allows only one thread to access some data at any given time.  To access
the data in a mutex, a thread must first signal that it wants access by
asking to acquire the mutex's ‘lock’.  The lock is a data structure that
is part of the mutex that keeps track of who currently has exclusive
access to the data.  Therefore, the mutex is described as ‘guarding’ the
data it holds via the locking system.

Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to
remember two rules:

   • You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.
   • When you're done with the data that the mutex guards, you must
     unlock the data so other threads can acquire the lock.

For a real-world metaphor for a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at a
conference with only one microphone.  Before a panelist can speak, they
have to ask or signal that they want to use the microphone.  When they
get the microphone, they can talk for as long as they want to and then
hand the microphone to the next panelist who requests to speak.  If a
panelist forgets to hand the microphone off when they're finished with
it, no one else is able to speak.  If management of the shared
microphone goes wrong, the panel won't work as planned!

Management of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, which is
why so many people are enthusiastic about channels.  However, thanks to
Rust's type system and ownership rules, you can't get locking and
unlocking wrong.  The API of ‘Mutex<T>’ As an example of how to use a
mutex, let's start by using a mutex in a single-threaded context, as
shown in Listing 16-12:

use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);

    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }

    println!("m = {m:?}");
}

As with many types, we create a ‘Mutex<T>’ using the associated function
‘new’.  To access the data inside the mutex, we use the ‘lock’ method to
acquire the lock.  This call will block the current thread so it can't
do any work until it's our turn to have the lock.

The call to ‘lock’ would fail if another thread holding the lock
panicked.  In that case, no one would ever be able to get the lock, so
we've chosen to ‘unwrap’ and have this thread panic if we're in that
situation.

After we've acquired the lock, we can treat the return value, named
‘num’ in this case, as a mutable reference to the data inside.  The type
system ensures that we acquire a lock before using the value in ‘m’.
The type of ‘m’ is ‘Mutex<i32>’, not ‘i32’, so we ‘must’ call ‘lock’ to
be able to use the ‘i32’ value.  We can't forget; the type system won't
let us access the inner ‘i32’ otherwise.

As you might suspect, ‘Mutex<T>’ is a smart pointer.  More accurately,
the call to ‘lock’ ‘returns’ a smart pointer called ‘MutexGuard’,
wrapped in a ‘LockResult’ that we handled with the call to ‘unwrap’.
The ‘MutexGuard’ smart pointer implements ‘Deref’ to point at our inner
data; the smart pointer also has a ‘Drop’ implementation that releases
the lock automatically when a ‘MutexGuard’ goes out of scope, which
happens at the end of the inner scope.  As a result, we don't risk
forgetting to release the lock and blocking the mutex from being used by
other threads, because the lock release happens automatically.

After dropping the lock, we can print the mutex value and see that we
were able to change the inner ‘i32’ to 6.  Sharing a ‘Mutex<T>’ Between
Multiple Threads Now, let's try to share a value between multiple
threads using ‘Mutex<T>’.  We'll spin up 10 threads and have them each
increment a counter value by 1, so the counter goes from 0 to 10.  The
next example in Listing 16-13 will have a compiler error, and we'll use
that error to learn more about using ‘Mutex<T>’ and how Rust helps us
use it correctly.

use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}

We create a ‘counter’ variable to hold an ‘i32’ inside a ‘Mutex<T>’, as
we did in Listing 16-12.  Next, we create 10 threads by iterating over a
range of numbers.  We use ‘thread::spawn’ and give all the threads the
same closure: one that moves the counter into the thread, acquires a
lock on the ‘Mutex<T>’ by calling the ‘lock’ method, and then adds 1 to
the value in the mutex.  When a thread finishes running its closure,
‘num’ will go out of scope and release the lock so another thread can
acquire it.

In the main thread, we collect all the join handles.  Then, as we did in
Listing 16-2, we call ‘join’ on each handle to make sure all the threads
finish.  At that point, the main thread will acquire the lock and print
the result of this program.

We hinted that this example wouldn't compile.  Now let's find out why!

The error message states that the ‘counter’ value was moved in the
previous iteration of the loop.  Rust is telling us that we can't move
the ownership of ‘counter’ into multiple threads.  Let's fix the
compiler error with a multiple-ownership method we discussed in Chapter
15.  Multiple Ownership with Multiple Threads In Chapter 15, we gave a
value multiple owners by using the smart pointer ‘Rc<T>’ to create a
reference counted value.  Let's do the same here and see what happens.
We'll wrap the ‘Mutex<T>’ in ‘Rc<T>’ in Listing 16-14 and clone the
‘Rc<T>’ before moving ownership to the thread.

use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Rc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Rc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}

Once again, we compile and get...  different errors!  The compiler is
teaching us a lot.

error: could not compile `shared-state` (bin "shared-state") due to 1 previous error

Wow, that error message is very wordy!  Here's the important part to
focus on: ‘`Rc<Mutex<i32>>` cannot be sent between threads safely’.  The
compiler is also telling us the reason why: ‘the trait `Send` is not
implemented for `Rc<Mutex<i32>>`’.  We'll talk about ‘Send’ in the next
section: it's one of the traits that ensures the types we use with
threads are meant for use in concurrent situations.

Unfortunately, ‘Rc<T>’ is not safe to share across threads.  When
‘Rc<T>’ manages the reference count, it adds to the count for each call
to ‘clone’ and subtracts from the count when each clone is dropped.  But
it doesn't use any concurrency primitives to make sure that changes to
the count can't be interrupted by another thread.  This could lead to
wrong counts--subtle bugs that could in turn lead to memory leaks or a
value being dropped before we're done with it.  What we need is a type
exactly like ‘Rc<T>’ but one that makes changes to the reference count
in a thread-safe way.  Atomic Reference Counting with ‘Arc<T>’
Fortunately, ‘Arc<T>’ ‘is’ a type like ‘Rc<T>’ that is safe to use in
concurrent situations.  The ‘a’ stands for ‘atomic’, meaning it's an
‘atomically reference counted’ type.  Atomics are an additional kind of
concurrency primitive that we won't cover in detail here: see the
standard library documentation for ‘stdsyncatomic’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/sync/atomic/index.html) for more
details.  At this point, you just need to know that atomics work like
primitive types but are safe to share across threads.

You might then wonder why all primitive types aren't atomic and why
standard library types aren't implemented to use ‘Arc<T>’ by default.
The reason is that thread safety comes with a performance penalty that
you only want to pay when you really need to.  If you're just performing
operations on values within a single thread, your code can run faster if
it doesn't have to enforce the guarantees atomics provide.

Let's return to our example: ‘Arc<T>’ and ‘Rc<T>’ have the same API, so
we fix our program by changing the ‘use’ line, the call to ‘new’, and
the call to ‘clone’.  The code in Listing 16-15 will finally compile and
run:

use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}

This code will print the following:

Result: 10

We did it!  We counted from 0 to 10, which may not seem very impressive,
but it did teach us a lot about ‘Mutex<T>’ and thread safety.  You could
also use this program's structure to do more complicated operations than
just incrementing a counter.  Using this strategy, you can divide a
calculation into independent parts, split those parts across threads,
and then use a ‘Mutex<T>’ to have each thread update the final result
with its part.

Note that if you are doing simple numerical operations, there are types
simpler than ‘Mutex<T>’ types provided by the ‘stdsyncatomic’ module of
the standard library
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/sync/atomic/index.html).  These
types provide safe, concurrent, atomic access to primitive types.  We
chose to use ‘Mutex<T>’ with a primitive type for this example so we
could concentrate on how ‘Mutex<T>’ works.

19.1.3.2 Similarities Between ‘RefCell<T>’/‘Rc<T>’ and
......................................................

‘Mutex<T>’/‘Arc<T>’ You might have noticed that ‘counter’ is immutable
but we could get a mutable reference to the value inside it; this means
‘Mutex<T>’ provides interior mutability, as the ‘Cell’ family does.  In
the same way we used ‘RefCell<T>’ in Chapter 15 to allow us to mutate
contents inside an ‘Rc<T>’, we use ‘Mutex<T>’ to mutate contents inside
an ‘Arc<T>’.

Another detail to note is that Rust can't protect you from all kinds of
logic errors when you use ‘Mutex<T>’.  Recall in Chapter 15 that using
‘Rc<T>’ came with the risk of creating reference cycles, where two
‘Rc<T>’ values refer to each other, causing memory leaks.  Similarly,
‘Mutex<T>’ comes with the risk of creating ‘deadlocks’.  These occur
when an operation needs to lock two resources and two threads have each
acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for each other forever.
If you're interested in deadlocks, try creating a Rust program that has
a deadlock; then research deadlock mitigation strategies for mutexes in
any language and have a go at implementing them in Rust.  The standard
library API documentation for ‘Mutex<T>’ and ‘MutexGuard’ offers useful
information.

We'll round out this chapter by talking about the ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’
traits and how we can use them with custom types.

19.1.4 Extensible Concurrency with the ‘Sync’ and ‘Send’
--------------------------------------------------------

Traits Interestingly, the Rust language has ‘very’ few concurrency
features.  Almost every concurrency feature we've talked about so far in
this chapter has been part of the standard library, not the language.
Your options for handling concurrency are not limited to the language or
the standard library; you can write your own concurrency features or use
those written by others.

However, two concurrency concepts are embedded in the language: the
‘std::marker’ traits ‘Sync’ and ‘Send’.

19.1.4.1 Allowing Transference of Ownership Between Threads with
................................................................

‘Send’ The ‘Send’ marker trait indicates that ownership of values of the
type implementing ‘Send’ can be transferred between threads.  Almost
every Rust type is ‘Send’, but there are some exceptions, including
‘Rc<T>’: this cannot be ‘Send’ because if you cloned an ‘Rc<T>’ value
and tried to transfer ownership of the clone to another thread, both
threads might update the reference count at the same time.  For this
reason, ‘Rc<T>’ is implemented for use in single-threaded situations
where you don't want to pay the thread-safe performance penalty.

Therefore, Rust's type system and trait bounds ensure that you can never
accidentally send an ‘Rc<T>’ value across threads unsafely.  When we
tried to do this in Listing 16-14, we got the error ‘the trait Send is
not implemented for Rc<Mutex<i32>>’.  When we switched to ‘Arc<T>’,
which is ‘Send’, the code compiled.

Any type composed entirely of ‘Send’ types is automatically marked as
‘Send’ as well.  Almost all primitive types are ‘Send’, aside from raw
pointers, which we'll discuss in Chapter 20.

19.1.4.2 Allowing Access from Multiple Threads with ‘Sync’
..........................................................

The ‘Sync’ marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type
implementing ‘Sync’ to be referenced from multiple threads.  In other
words, any type ‘T’ is ‘Sync’ if ‘&T’ (an immutable reference to ‘T’) is
‘Send’, meaning the reference can be sent safely to another thread.
Similar to ‘Send’, primitive types are ‘Sync’, and types composed
entirely of types that are ‘Sync’ are also ‘Sync’.

The smart pointer ‘Rc<T>’ is also not ‘Sync’ for the same reasons that
it's not ‘Send’.  The ‘RefCell<T>’ type (which we talked about in
Chapter 15) and the family of related ‘Cell<T>’ types are not ‘Sync’.
The implementation of borrow checking that ‘RefCell<T>’ does at runtime
is not thread-safe.  The smart pointer ‘Mutex<T>’ is ‘Sync’ and can be
used to share access with multiple threads as you saw in the *note
“Sharing a ‘Mutex<T>’ Between Multiple Threads”:

19.1.4.3 Implementing ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’ Manually Is
...................................................

Unsafe Because types that are made up of ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’ traits are
automatically also ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’, we don't have to implement those
traits manually.  As marker traits, they don't even have any methods to
implement.  They're just useful for enforcing invariants related to
concurrency.

Manually implementing these traits involves implementing unsafe Rust
code.  We'll talk about using unsafe Rust code in Chapter 20; for now,
the important information is that building new concurrent types not made
up of ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’ parts requires careful thought to uphold the
safety guarantees.  “The Rustonomicon”
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../nomicon/index.html) has more
information about these guarantees and how to uphold them.

19.1.5 Summary
--------------

This isn't the last you'll see of concurrency in this book: the whole
next chapter focuses on async programming, and the project in Chapter 21
will use the concepts in this chapter in a more realistic situation than
the smaller examples discussed here.

As mentioned earlier, because very little of how Rust handles
concurrency is part of the language, many concurrency solutions are
implemented as crates.  These evolve more quickly than the standard
library, so be sure to search online for the current, state-of-the-art
crates to use in multithreaded situations.

The Rust standard library provides channels for message passing and
smart pointer types, such as ‘Mutex<T>’ and ‘Arc<T>’, that are safe to
use in concurrent contexts.  The type system and the borrow checker
ensure that the code using these solutions won't end up with data races
or invalid references.  Once you get your code to compile, you can rest
assured that it will happily run on multiple threads without the kinds
of hard-to-track-down bugs common in other languages.  Concurrent
programming is no longer a concept to be afraid of: go forth and make
your programs concurrent, fearlessly!

19.2 Async and Await
====================

Many operations we ask the computer to do can take a while to finish.
For example, if you used a video editor to create a video of a family
celebration, exporting it could take anywhere from minutes to hours.
Similarly, downloading a video shared by someone in your family might
take a long time.  It would be nice if we could do something else while
we are waiting for those long-running processes to complete.

The video export will use as much CPU and GPU power as it can.  If you
only had one CPU core, and your operating system never paused that
export until it completed, you couldn't do anything else on your
computer while it was running.  That would be a pretty frustrating
experience, though.  Instead, your computer's operating system can--and
does!--invisibly interrupt the export often enough to let you get other
work done along the way.

The file download is different.  It does not take up very much CPU time.
Instead, the CPU needs to wait on data to arrive from the network.
While you can start reading the data once some of it is present, it
might take a while for the rest to show up.  Even once the data is all
present, a video can be quite large, so it might take some time to load
it all.  Maybe it only takes a second or two--but that's a very long
time for a modern processor, which can do billions of operations every
second.  It would be nice to be able to put the CPU to use for other
work while waiting for the network call to finish--so, again, your
operating system will invisibly interrupt your program so other things
can happen while the network operation is still ongoing.

Note: The video export is the kind of operation which is often described
as “CPU-bound” or “compute-bound”.  It's limited by the speed of the
computer's ability to process data within the ‘CPU’ or ‘GPU’, and how
much of that speed it can use.  The video download is the kind of
operation which is often described as “IO-bound,” because it's limited
by the speed of the computer's ‘input and output’.  It can only go as
fast as the data can be sent across the network.

In both of these examples, the operating system's invisible interrupts
provide a form of concurrency.  That concurrency only happens at the
level of a whole program, though: the operating system interrupts one
program to let other programs get work done.  In many cases, because we
understand our programs at a much more granular level than the operating
system does, we can spot lots of opportunities for concurrency that the
operating system cannot see.

For example, if we're building a tool to manage file downloads, we
should be able to write our program in such a way that starting one
download does not lock up the UI, and users should be able to start
multiple downloads at the same time.  Many operating system APIs for
interacting with the network are ‘blocking’, though.  That is, these
APIs block the program's progress until the data that they are
processing is completely ready.

Note: This is how ‘most’ function calls work, if you think about it!
However, we normally reserve the term “blocking” for function calls
which interact with files, the network, or other resources on the
computer, because those are the places where an individual program would
benefit from the operation being ‘non’-blocking.

We could avoid blocking our main thread by spawning a dedicated thread
to download each file.  However, we would eventually find that the
overhead of those threads was a problem.  It would also be nicer if the
call were not blocking in the first place.  Last but not least, it would
be better if we could write in the same direct style we use in blocking
code.  Something similar to this:

let data = fetch_data_from(url).await;
println!("{data}");

That is exactly what Rust's async abstraction gives us.  Before we see
how this works in practice, though, we need to take a short detour into
the differences between parallelism and concurrency.

19.2.1 Parallelism and Concurrency
----------------------------------

In the previous chapter, we treated parallelism and concurrency as
mostly interchangeable.  Now we need to distinguish between them more
precisely, because the differences will show up as we start working.

Consider the different ways a team could split up work on a software
project.  We could assign a single individual multiple tasks, or we
could assign one task per team member, or we could do a mix of both
approaches.

When an individual works on several different tasks before any of them
is complete, this is ‘concurrency’.  Maybe you have two different
projects checked out on your computer, and when you get bored or stuck
on one project, you switch to the other.  You're just one person, so you
can't make progress on both tasks at the exact same time--but you can
multi-task, making progress on multiple tasks by switching between them.

When you agree to split up a group of tasks between the people on the
team, with each person taking one task and working on it alone, this is
‘parallelism’.  Each person on the team can make progress at the exact
same time.

With both of these situations, you might have to coordinate between
different tasks.  Maybe you ‘thought’ the task that one person was
working on was totally independent from everyone else's work, but it
actually needs something finished by another person on the team.  Some
of the work could be done in parallel, but some of it was actually
‘serial’: it could only happen in a series, one thing after the other,
as in Figure 17-3.

Likewise, you might realize that one of your own tasks depends on
another of your tasks.  Now your concurrent work has also become serial.

Parallelism and concurrency can intersect with each other, too.  If you
learn that a colleague is stuck until you finish one of your tasks,
you'll probably focus all your efforts on that task to “unblock” your
colleague.  You and your coworker are no longer able to work in
parallel, and you're also no longer able to work concurrently on your
own tasks.

The same basic dynamics come into play with software and hardware.  On a
machine with a single CPU core, the CPU can only do one operation at a
time, but it can still work concurrently.  Using tools such as threads,
processes, and async, the computer can pause one activity and switch to
others before eventually cycling back to that first activity again.  On
a machine with multiple CPU cores, it can also do work in parallel.  One
core can be doing one thing while another core does something completely
unrelated, and those actually happen at the same time.

When working with async in Rust, we're always dealing with concurrency.
Depending on the hardware, the operating system, and the async runtime
we are using--more on async runtimes shortly!--that concurrency may also
use parallelism under the hood.

Now, let's dive into how async programming in Rust actually works!  In
the rest of this chapter, we will:

   • see how to use Rust's ‘async’ and ‘await’ syntax
   • explore how to use the async model to solve some of the same
     challenges we looked at in Chapter 16
   • look at how multithreading and async provide complementary
     solutions, which you can even use together in many cases

19.2.2 Futures and the Async Syntax
-----------------------------------

The key elements of asynchronous programming in Rust are ‘futures’ and
Rust's ‘async’ and ‘await’ keywords.

A ‘future’ is a value which may not be ready now, but will become ready
at some point in the future.  (This same concept shows up in many
languages, sometimes under other names such as “task” or “promise”.)
Rust provides a ‘Future’ trait as a building block so different async
operations can be implemented with different data structures, but with a
common interface.  In Rust, we say that types which implement the
‘Future’ trait are futures.  Each type which implements ‘Future’ holds
its own information about the progress that has been made and what
"ready" means.

The ‘async’ keyword can be applied to blocks and functions to specify
that they can be interrupted and resumed.  Within an async block or
async function, you can use the ‘await’ keyword to wait for a future to
become ready, called ‘awaiting a future’.  Each place you await a future
within an async block or function is a place that async block or
function may get paused and resumed.  The process of checking with a
future to see if its value is available yet is called ‘polling’.

Some other languages also use ‘async’ and ‘await’ keywords for async
programming.  If you're familiar with those languages, you may notice
some significant differences in how Rust does things, including how it
handles the syntax.  That's for good reason, as we'll see!

Most of the time when writing async Rust, we use the ‘async’ and ‘await’
keywords.  Rust compiles them into equivalent code using the ‘Future’
trait, much as it compiles ‘for’ loops into equivalent code using the
‘Iterator’ trait.  Because Rust provides the ‘Future’ trait, though, you
can also implement it for your own data types when you need to.  Many of
the functions we'll see throughout this chapter return types with their
own implementations of ‘Future’.  We'll return to the definition of the
trait at the end of the chapter and dig into more of how it works, but
this is enough detail to keep us moving forward.

That may all feel a bit abstract.  Let's write our first async program:
a little web scraper.  We'll pass in two URLs from the command line,
fetch both of them concurrently, and return the result of whichever one
finishes first.  This example will have a fair bit of new syntax, but
don't worry.  We'll explain everything you need to know as we go.

19.2.2.1 Our First Async Program
................................

To keep this chapter focused on learning async, rather than juggling
parts of the ecosystem, we have created the ‘trpl’ crate (‘trpl’ is
short for “The Rust Programming Language”).  It re-exports all the
types, traits, and functions you'll need, primarily from the ‘futures’
(https://crates.io/crates/futures) and ‘tokio’ (https://tokio.rs)
crates.

   • The ‘futures’ crate is an official home for Rust experimentation
     for async code, and is actually where the ‘Future’ type was
     originally designed.

   • Tokio is the most widely used async runtime in Rust today,
     especially (but not only!)  for web applications.  There are other
     great runtimes out there, and they may be more suitable for your
     purposes.  We use Tokio under the hood for ‘trpl’ because it's
     well-tested and widely used.

In some cases, ‘trpl’ also renames or wraps the original APIs to let us
stay focused on the details relevant to this chapter.  If you want to
understand what the crate does, we encourage you to check out its source
code (https://github.com/rust-lang/book/tree/main/packages/trpl).
You'll be able to see what crate each re-export comes from, and we've
left extensive comments explaining what the crate does.

Create a new binary project named ‘hello-async’ and add the ‘trpl’ crate
as a dependency:

$ cargo new hello-async
$ cd hello-async
$ cargo add trpl

Now we can use the various pieces provided by ‘trpl’ to write our first
async program.  We'll build a little command line tool which fetches two
web pages, pulls the ‘<title>’ element from each, and prints out the
title of whichever finishes that whole process first.

Let's start by writing a function that takes one page URL as a
parameter, makes a request to it, and returns the text of the title
element:

use trpl::Html;

async fn page_title(url: &str) -> Option<String> {
    let response = trpl::get(url).await;
    let response_text = response.text().await;
    Html::parse(&response_text)
        .select_first("title")
        .map(|title_element| title_element.inner_html())
}

In Listing 17-1, we define a function named ‘page_title’, and we mark it
with the ‘async’ keyword.  Then we use the ‘trpl::get’ function to fetch
whatever URL is passed in, and we await the response by using the
‘await’ keyword.  Then we get the text of the response by calling its
‘text’ method, and once again await it with the ‘await’ keyword.  Both
of these steps are asynchronous.  For ‘get’, we need to wait for the
server to send back the first part of its response, which will include
HTTP headers, cookies, and so on.  That part of the response can be
delivered separately from the body of the request.  Especially if the
body is very large, it can take some time for it all to arrive.  Thus,
we have to wait for the ‘entirety’ of the response to arrive, so the
‘text’ method is also async.

We have to explicitly await both of these futures, because futures in
Rust are ‘lazy’: they don't do anything until you ask them to with
‘await’.  (In fact, Rust will show a compiler warning if you don't use a
future.)  This should remind you of our discussion of iterators *note
back in Chapter 13: Processing a Series of Items with Iterators.
Iterators do nothing unless you call their ‘next’ method--whether
directly, or using ‘for’ loops or methods such as ‘map’ which use ‘next’
under the hood.  With futures, the same basic idea applies: they do
nothing unless you explicitly ask them to.  This laziness allows Rust to
avoid running async code until it's actually needed.

Note: This is different from the behavior we saw when using
‘thread::spawn’ in the previous chapter, where the closure we passed to
another thread started running immediately.  It's also different from
how many other languages approach async!  But it's important for Rust.
We'll see why that is later.

Once we have ‘response_text’, we can then parse it into an instance of
the ‘Html’ type using ‘Html::parse’.  Instead of a raw string, we now
have a data type we can use to work with the HTML as a richer data
structure.  In particular, we can use the ‘select_first’ method to find
the first instance of a given CSS selector.  By passing the string
‘"title"’, we'll get the first ‘<title>’ element in the document, if
there is one.  Because there may not be any matching element,
‘select_first’ returns an ‘Option<ElementRef>’.  Finally, we use the
‘Option::map’ method, which lets us work with the item in the ‘Option’
if it's present, and do nothing if it isn't.  (We could also use a
‘match’ expression here, but ‘map’ is more idiomatic.)  In the body of
the function we supply to ‘map’, we call ‘inner_html’ on the
‘title_element’ to get its content, which is a ‘String’.  When all is
said and done, we have an ‘Option<String>’.

Notice that Rust's ‘await’ keyword goes after the expression you're
awaiting, not before it.  That is, it's a ‘postfix keyword’.  This may
be different from what you might be used to if you have used async in
other languages.  Rust chose this because it makes chains of methods
much nicer to work with.  As a result, we can change the body of
‘page_url_for’ to chain the ‘trpl::get’ and ‘text’ function calls
together with ‘await’ between them, as shown in Listing 17-2:

    let response_text = trpl::get(url).await.text().await;

With that, we have successfully written our first async function!
Before we add some code in ‘main’ to call it, let's talk a little more
about what we've written and what it means.

When Rust sees a block marked with the ‘async’ keyword, it compiles it
into a unique, anonymous data type which implements the ‘Future’ trait.
When Rust sees a function marked with ‘async’, it compiles it into a
non-async function whose body is an async block.  An async function's
return type is the type of the anonymous data type the compiler creates
for that async block.

Thus, writing ‘async fn’ is equivalent to writing a function which
returns a ‘future’ of the return type.  When the compiler sees a
function definition such as the ‘async fn page_title’ in Listing 17-1,
it's equivalent to a non-async function defined like this:

use std::future::Future;
use trpl::Html;

fn page_title(url: &str) -> impl Future<Output = Option<String>> + '_ {
    async move {
        let text = trpl::get(url).await.text().await;
        Html::parse(&text)
            .select_first("title")
            .map(|title| title.inner_html())
    }
}

Let's walk through each part of the transformed version:

   • It uses the ‘impl Trait’ syntax we discussed back in the *note
     “Traits as Parameters”: Traits as Parameters. section in Chapter
     10.
   • The returned trait is a ‘Future’, with an associated type of
     ‘Output’.  Notice that the ‘Output’ type is ‘Option<String>’, which
     is the same as the the original return type from the ‘async fn’
     version of ‘page_title’.
   • All of the code called in the body of the original function is
     wrapped in an ‘async move’ block.  Remember that blocks are
     expressions.  This whole block is the expression returned from the
     function.
   • This async block produces a value with the type ‘Option<String>’,
     as described above.  That value matches the ‘Output’ type in the
     return type.  This is just like other blocks you have seen.
   • The new function body is an ‘async move’ block because of how it
     uses the ‘url’ parameter.  (We'll talk about ‘async’ vs.  ‘async
     move’ much more later in the chapter.)
   • The new version of the function has a kind of lifetime we haven't
     seen before in the output type: ‘'_’.  Because the function returns
     a ‘Future’ which refers to a reference--in this case, the reference
     from the ‘url’ parameter--we need to tell Rust that we mean for
     that reference to be included.  We don't have to name the lifetime
     here, because Rust is smart enough to know there is only one
     reference which could be involved, but we ‘do’ have to be explicit
     that the resulting ‘Future’ is bound by that lifetime.

Now we can call ‘page_title’ in ‘main’.  To start, we'll just get the
title for a single page.  In Listing 17-3, we follow the same pattern we
used for getting command line arguments back in Chapter 12.  Then we
pass the first URL ‘page_title’, and await the result.  Because the
value produced by the future is an ‘Option<String>’, we use a ‘match’
expression to print different messages to account for whether the page
had a ‘<title>’.

async fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
    let url = &args[1];
    match page_title(url).await {
        Some(title) => println!("The title for {url} was {title}"),
        None => println!("{url} had no title"),
    }
}

Unfortunately, this doesn't compile.  The only place we can use the
‘await’ keyword is in async functions or blocks, and Rust won't let us
mark the special ‘main’ function as ‘async’.

error[E0752]: `main` function is not allowed to be `async`
 --> src/main.rs:6:1
  |
6 | async fn main() {
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `main` function is not allowed to be `async`

The reason ‘main’ can't be marked ‘async’ is that async code needs a
‘runtime’: a Rust crate which manages the details of executing
asynchronous code.  A program's ‘main’ function can ‘initialize’ a
runtime, but it's not a runtime ‘itself’.  (We'll see more about why
this is a bit later.)  Every Rust program that executes async code has
at least one place where it sets up a runtime and executes the futures.

Most languages which support async bundle a runtime with the language.
Rust does not.  Instead, there are many different async runtimes
available, each of which makes different tradeoffs suitable to the use
case they target.  For example, a high-throughput web server with many
CPU cores and a large amount of RAM has very different needs than a
microcontroller with a single core, a small amount of RAM, and no
ability to do heap allocations.  The crates which provide those runtimes
also often supply async versions of common functionality such as file or
network I/O.

Here, and throughout the rest of this chapter, we'll use the ‘run’
function from the ‘trpl’ crate, which takes a future as an argument and
runs it to completion.  Behind the scenes, calling ‘run’ sets up a
runtime to use to run the future passed in.  Once the future completes,
‘run’ returns whatever value the future produced.

We could pass the future returned by ‘page_title’ directly to ‘run’.
Once it completed, we would be able to match on the resulting
‘Option<String>’, the way we tried to do in Listing 17-3.  However, for
most of the examples in the chapter (and most async code in the real
world!), we'll be doing more than just one async function call, so
instead we'll pass an ‘async’ block and explicitly await the result of
calling ‘page_title’, as in Listing 17-4.

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    trpl::run(async {
        let url = &args[1];
        match page_title(url).await {
            Some(title) => println!("The title for {url} was {title}"),
            None => println!("{url} had no title"),
        }
    })
}

When we run this, we get the behavior we might have expected initially:

$ cargo run -- https://www.rust-lang.org
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s
     Running `target/debug/async_await 'https://www.rust-lang.org'`
The title for https://www.rust-lang.org was
            Rust Programming Language

Phew: we finally have some working async code!  This now compiles, and
we can run it.  Before we add code to race two sites against each other,
let's briefly turn our attention back to how futures work.

Each ‘await point’--that is, every place where the code uses the ‘await’
keyword--represents a place where control gets handed back to the
runtime.  To make that work, Rust needs to keep track of the state
involved in the async block, so that the runtime can kick off some other
work and then come back when it's ready to try advancing this one again.
This is an invisible state machine, as if you wrote an enum in this way
to save the current state at each ‘await’ point:

enum PageTitleFuture<'a> {
    Initial { url: &'a str },
    GetAwaitPoint { url: &'a str },
    TextAwaitPoint { response: trpl::Response },
}

Writing the code to transition between each state by hand would be
tedious and error-prone, especially when adding more functionality and
more states to the code later.  Instead, the Rust compiler creates and
manages the state machine data structures for async code automatically.
If you're wondering: yep, the normal borrowing and ownership rules
around data structures all apply.  Happily, the compiler also handles
checking those for us, and has good error messages.  We'll work through
a few of those later in the chapter!

Ultimately, something has to execute that state machine.  That something
is a runtime.  (This is why you may sometimes come across references to
‘executors’ when looking into runtimes: an executor is the part of a
runtime responsible for executing the async code.)

Now we can understand why the compiler stopped us from making ‘main’
itself an async function back in Listing 17-3.  If ‘main’ were an async
function, something else would need to manage the state machine for
whatever future ‘main’ returned, but ‘main’ is the starting point for
the program!  Instead, we call the ‘trpl::run’ function in ‘main’, which
sets up a runtime and runs the future returned by the ‘async’ block
until it returns ‘Ready’.

Note: some runtimes provide macros to make it so you ‘can’ write an
async main function.  Those macros rewrite ‘async fn main() { ... }’ to
be a normal ‘fn main’ which does the same thing we did by hand in
Listing 17-5: call a function which runs a future to completion the way
‘trpl::run’ does.

Let's put these pieces together and see how we can write concurrent
code, by calling ‘page_title’ with two different URLs passed in from the
command line and racing them.

use trpl::{Either, Html};

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    trpl::run(async {
        let title_fut_1 = page_title(&args[1]);
        let title_fut_2 = page_title(&args[2]);

        let (url, maybe_title) =
            match trpl::race(title_fut_1, title_fut_2).await {
                Either::Left(left) => left,
                Either::Right(right) => right,
            };

        println!("{url} returned first");
        match maybe_title {
            Some(title) => println!("Its page title is: '{title}'"),
            None => println!("Its title could not be parsed."),
        }
    })
}

async fn page_title(url: &str) -> (&str, Option<String>) {
    let text = trpl::get(url).await.text().await;
    let title = Html::parse(&text)
        .select_first("title")
        .map(|title| title.inner_html());
    (url, title)
}

In Listing 17-5, we begin by calling ‘page_title’ for each of the
user-supplied URLs.  We save the futures produced by calling
‘page_title’ as ‘title_fut_1’ and ‘title_fut_2’.  Remember, these don't
do anything yet, because futures are lazy, and we haven't yet awaited
them.  Then we pass the futures to ‘trpl::race’, which returns a value
to indicate which of the futures passed to it finishes first.

Note: Under the hood, ‘race’ is built on a more general function,
‘select’, which you will encounter more often in real-world Rust code.
A ‘select’ function can do a lot of things that ‘trpl::race’ function
can't, but it also has some additional complexity that we can skip over
for now.

Either future can legitimately “win,” so it doesn't make sense to return
a ‘Result’.  Instead, ‘race’ returns a type we haven't seen before,
‘trpl::Either’.  The ‘Either’ type is somewhat similar to a ‘Result’, in
that it has two cases.  Unlike ‘Result’, though, there is no notion of
success or failure baked into ‘Either’.  Instead, it uses ‘Left’ and
‘Right’ to indicate “one or the other”.

enum Either<A, B> {
    Left(A),
    Right(B),
}

The ‘race’ function returns ‘Left’ if the first argument finishes first,
with that future's output, and ‘Right’ with the second future argument's
output if ‘that’ one finishes first.  This matches the order the
arguments appear when calling the function: the first argument is to the
left of the second argument.

We also update ‘page_title’ to return the same URL passed in.  That way,
if the page which returns first does not have a ‘<title>’ we can
resolve, we can still print a meaningful message.  With that information
available, we wrap up by updating our ‘println!’ output to indicate both
which URL finished first and what the ‘<title>’ was for the web page at
that URL, if any.

You have built a small working web scraper now!  Pick a couple URLs and
run the command line tool.  You may discover that some sites are
reliably faster than others, while in other cases which site “wins”
varies from run to run.  More importantly, you've learned the basics of
working with futures, so we can now dig into even more of the things we
can do with async.

19.2.3 Concurrency With Async
-----------------------------

In this section, we'll apply async to some of the same concurrency
challenges we tackled with threads in chapter 16.  Because we already
talked about a lot of the key ideas there, in this section we'll focus
on what's different between threads and futures.

In many cases, the APIs for working with concurrency using async are
very similar to those for using threads.  In other cases, they end up
being shaped quite differently.  Even when the APIs ‘look’ similar
between threads and async, they often have different behavior--and they
nearly always have different performance characteristics.

* Counting::
* Message Passing::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Counting,  Next: Message Passing,  Prev: Concurrency With Async,  Up: Concurrency With Async

19.2.3.1 Counting
.................

The first task we tackled in Chapter 16 was counting up on two separate
threads.  Let's do the same using async.  The ‘trpl’ crate supplies a
‘spawn_task’ function which looks very similar to the ‘thread::spawn’
API, and a ‘sleep’ function which is an async version of the
‘thread::sleep’ API. We can use these together to implement the same
counting example as with threads, in Listing 17-6.

use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        trpl::spawn_task(async {
            for i in 1..10 {
                println!("hi number {i} from the first task!");
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        });

        for i in 1..5 {
            println!("hi number {i} from the second task!");
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
        }
    });
}

As our starting point, we set up our ‘main’ function with ‘trpl::run’,
so that our top-level function can be async.

Note: From this point forward in the chapter, every example will include
this exact same wrapping code with ‘trpl::run’ in ‘main’, so we'll often
skip it just as we do with ‘main’.  Don't forget to include it in your
code!

Then we write two loops within that block, each with a ‘trpl::sleep’
call in it, which waits for half a second (500 milliseconds) before
sending the next message.  We put one loop in the body of a
‘trpl::spawn_task’ and the other in a top-level ‘for’ loop.  We also add
an ‘await’ after the ‘sleep’ calls.

This does something similar to the thread-based
implementation--including the fact that you may see the messages appear
in a different order in your own terminal when you run it.

hi number 1 from the second task!
hi number 1 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the second task!
hi number 3 from the first task!
hi number 3 from the second task!
hi number 4 from the first task!
hi number 4 from the second task!
hi number 5 from the first task!

This version stops as soon as the for loop in the body of the main async
block finishes, because the task spawned by ‘spawn_task’ is shut down
when the main function ends.  If you want to run all the way to the
completion of the task, you will need to use a join handle to wait for
the first task to complete.  With threads, we used the ‘join’ method to
“block” until the thread was done running.  In Listing 17-7, we can use
‘await’ to do the same thing, because the task handle itself is a
future.  Its ‘Output’ type is a ‘Result’, so we also unwrap it after
awaiting it.

        let handle = trpl::spawn_task(async {
            for i in 1..10 {
                println!("hi number {i} from the first task!");
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        });

        for i in 1..5 {
            println!("hi number {i} from the second task!");
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
        }

        handle.await.unwrap();

This updated version runs till ‘both’ loops finish.

hi number 1 from the second task!
hi number 1 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the second task!
hi number 3 from the first task!
hi number 3 from the second task!
hi number 4 from the first task!
hi number 4 from the second task!
hi number 5 from the first task!
hi number 6 from the first task!
hi number 7 from the first task!
hi number 8 from the first task!
hi number 9 from the first task!

So far, it looks like async and threads give us the same basic outcomes,
just with different syntax: using ‘await’ instead of calling ‘join’ on
the join handle, and awaiting the ‘sleep’ calls.

The bigger difference is that we didn't need to spawn another operating
system thread to do this.  In fact, we don't even need to spawn a task
here.  Because async blocks compile to anonymous futures, we can put
each loop in an async block and have the runtime run them both to
completion using the ‘trpl::join’ function.

In Chapter 16, we showed how to use the ‘join’ method on the
‘JoinHandle’ type returned when you call ‘std::thread::spawn’.  The
‘trpl::join’ function is similar, but for futures.  When you give it two
futures, it produces a single new future whose output is a tuple with
the output of each of the futures you passed in once ‘both’ complete.
Thus, in Listing 17-8, we use ‘trpl::join’ to wait for both ‘fut1’ and
‘fut2’ to finish.  We do ‘not’ await ‘fut1’ and ‘fut2’, but instead the
new future produced by ‘trpl::join’.  We ignore the output, because it's
just a tuple with two unit values in it.

        let fut1 = async {
            for i in 1..10 {
                println!("hi number {i} from the first task!");
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        };

        let fut2 = async {
            for i in 1..5 {
                println!("hi number {i} from the second task!");
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        };

        trpl::join(fut1, fut2).await;

When we run this, we see both futures run to completion:

hi number 1 from the first task!
hi number 1 from the second task!
hi number 2 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the second task!
hi number 3 from the first task!
hi number 3 from the second task!
hi number 4 from the first task!
hi number 4 from the second task!
hi number 5 from the first task!
hi number 6 from the first task!
hi number 7 from the first task!
hi number 8 from the first task!
hi number 9 from the first task!

Here, you'll see the exact same order every time, which is very
different from what we saw with threads.  That is because the
‘trpl::join’ function is ‘fair’, meaning it checks each future equally
often, alternating between them, and never lets one race ahead if the
other is ready.  With threads, the operating system decides which thread
to check and how long to let it run.  With async Rust, the runtime
decides which task to check.  (In practice, the details get complicated
because an async runtime might use operating system threads under the
hood as part of how it manages concurrency, so guaranteeing fairness can
be more work for a runtime--but it's still possible!)  Runtimes don't
have to guarantee fairness for any given operation, and runtimes often
offer different APIs to let you choose whether you want fairness or not.

Try some of these different variations on awaiting the futures and see
what they do:

   • Remove the async block from around either or both of the loops.
   • Await each async block immediately after defining it.
   • Wrap only the first loop in an async block, and await the resulting
     future after the body of second loop.

For an extra challenge, see if you can figure out what the output will
be in each case ‘before’ running the code!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Message Passing,  Next: Working With Any Number of Futures,  Prev: Counting,  Up: Concurrency With Async

19.2.3.2 Message Passing
........................

Sharing data between futures will also be familiar: we'll use message
passing again, but this with async versions of the types and functions.
We'll take a slightly different path than we did in Chapter 16, to
illustrate some of the key differences between thread-based and
futures-based concurrency.  In Listing 17-9, we'll begin with just a
single async block--‘not’ spawning a separate task as we spawned a
separate thread.

        let (tx, mut rx) = trpl::channel();

        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();

        let received = rx.recv().await.unwrap();
        println!("Got: {received}");

Here, we use ‘trpl::channel’, an async version of the multiple-producer,
single-consumer channel API we used with threads back in Chapter 16.
The async version of the API is only a little different from the
thread-based version: it uses a mutable rather than an immutable
receiver ‘rx’, and its ‘recv’ method produces a future we need to await
rather than producing the value directly.  Now we can send messages from
the sender to the receiver.  Notice that we don't have to spawn a
separate thread or even a task; we merely need to await the ‘rx.recv’
call.

The synchronous ‘Receiver::recv’ method in ‘std::mpsc::channel’ blocks
until it receives a message.  The ‘trpl::Receiver::recv’ method does
not, because it is async.  Instead of blocking, it hands control back to
the runtime until either a message is received or the send side of the
channel closes.  By contrast, we don't await the ‘send’ call, because it
doesn't block.  It doesn't need to, because the channel we're sending it
into is unbounded.

Note: Because all of this async code runs in an async block in a
‘trpl::run’ call, everything within it can avoid blocking.  However, the
code ‘outside’ it will block on the ‘run’ function returning.  That is
the whole point of the ‘trpl::run’ function: it lets you ‘choose’ where
to block on some set of async code, and thus where to transition between
sync and async code.  In most async runtimes, ‘run’ is actually named
‘block_on’ for exactly this reason.

Notice two things about this example: First, the message will arrive
right away!  Second, although we use a future here, there's no
concurrency yet.  Everything in the listing happens in sequence, just as
it would if there were no futures involved.

Let's address the first part by sending a series of messages, and sleep
in between them, as shown in Listing 17-10:

        let (tx, mut rx) = trpl::channel();

        let vals = vec![
            String::from("hi"),
            String::from("from"),
            String::from("the"),
            String::from("future"),
        ];

        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
        }

        while let Some(value) = rx.recv().await {
            println!("received '{value}'");
        }

In addition to sending the messages, we need to receive them.  In this
case, we could do that manually, by just doing ‘rx.recv().await’ four
times, because we know how many messages are coming in.  In the real
world, though, we'll generally be waiting on some ‘unknown’ number of
messages.  In that case, we need to keep waiting until we determine that
there are no more messages.

In Listing 16-10, we used a ‘for’ loop to process all the items received
from a synchronous channel.  However, Rust doesn't yet have a way to
write a ‘for’ loop over an ‘asynchronous’ series of items.  Instead, we
need to use a new kind of loop we haven't seen before, the ‘while let’
conditional loop.  A ‘while let’ loop is the loop version of the ‘if
let’ construct we saw back in Chapter 6.  The loop will continue
executing as long as the pattern it specifies continues to match the
value.

The ‘rx.recv’ call produces a ‘Future’, which we await.  The runtime
will pause the ‘Future’ until it is ready.  Once a message arrives, the
future will resolve to ‘Some(message)’, as many times as a message
arrives.  When the channel closes, regardless of whether ‘any’ messages
have arrived, the future will instead resolve to ‘None’ to indicate that
there are no more values, and we should stop polling--that is, stop
awaiting.

The ‘while let’ loop pulls all of this together.  If the result of
calling ‘rx.recv().await’ is ‘Some(message)’, we get access to the
message and we can use it in the loop body, just as we could with ‘if
let’.  If the result is ‘None’, the loop ends.  Every time the loop
completes, it hits the await point again, so the runtime pauses it again
until another message arrives.

The code now successfully sends and receives all of the messages.
Unfortunately, there are still a couple problems.  For one thing, the
messages do not arrive at half-second intervals.  They arrive all at
once, two seconds (2,000 milliseconds) after we start the program.  For
another, this program also never exits!  Instead, it waits forever for
new messages.  You will need to shut it down using ctrl-c.

Let's start by understanding why the messages all come in at once after
the full delay, rather than coming in with delays in between each one.
Within a given async block, the order that ‘await’ keywords appear in
the code is also the order they happen when running the program.

There's only one async block in Listing 17-10, so everything in it runs
linearly.  There's still no concurrency.  All the ‘tx.send’ calls
happen, interspersed with all of the ‘trpl::sleep’ calls and their
associated await points.  Only then does the ‘while let’ loop get to go
through any of the ‘await’ points on the ‘recv’ calls.

To get the behavior we want, where the sleep delay happens between
receiving each message, we need to put the ‘tx’ and ‘rx’ operations in
their own async blocks.  Then the runtime can execute each of them
separately using ‘trpl::join’, just as in the counting example.  Once
again, we await the result of calling ‘trpl::join’, not the individual
futures.  If we awaited the individual futures in sequence, we would
just end up back in a sequential flow--exactly what we're trying ‘not’
to do.

        let tx_fut = async {
            let vals = vec![
                String::from("hi"),
                String::from("from"),
                String::from("the"),
                String::from("future"),
            ];

            for val in vals {
                tx.send(val).unwrap();
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        };

        let rx_fut = async {
            while let Some(value) = rx.recv().await {
                println!("received '{value}'");
            }
        };

        trpl::join(tx_fut, rx_fut).await;

With the updated code in Listing 17-11, the messages get printed at
500-millisecond intervals, rather than all in a rush after two seconds.

The program still never exits, though, because of the way ‘while let’
loop interacts with ‘trpl::join’:

   • The future returned from ‘trpl::join’ only completes once ‘both’
     futures passed to it have completed.
   • The ‘tx’ future completes once it finishes sleeping after sending
     the last message in ‘vals’.
   • The ‘rx’ future won't complete until the ‘while let’ loop ends.
   • The ‘while let’ loop won't end until awaiting ‘rx.recv’ produces
     ‘None’.
   • Awaiting ‘rx.recv’ will only return ‘None’ once the other end of
     the channel is closed.
   • The channel will only close if we call ‘rx.close’ or when the
     sender side, ‘tx’, is dropped.
   • We don't call ‘rx.close’ anywhere, and ‘tx’ won't be dropped until
     the outermost async block passed to ‘trpl::run’ ends.
   • The block can't end because it is blocked on ‘trpl::join’
     completing, which takes us back to the top of this list!

We could manually close ‘rx’ by calling ‘rx.close’ somewhere, but that
doesn't make much sense.  Stopping after handling some arbitrary number
of messages would make the program shut down, but we could miss
messages.  We need some other way to make sure that ‘tx’ gets dropped
‘before’ the end of the function.

Right now, the async block where we send the messages only borrows ‘tx’
because sending a message doesn't require ownership, but if we could
move ‘tx’ into that async block, it would be dropped once that block
ends.  In Chapter 13, we learned how to use the ‘move’ keyword with
closures, and in Chapter 16, we saw that we often need to move data into
closures when working with threads.  The same basic dynamics apply to
async blocks, so the ‘move’ keyword works with async blocks just as it
does with closures.

In Listing 17-12, we change the async block for sending messages from a
plain ‘async’ block to an ‘async move’ block.  When we run ‘this’
version of the code, it shuts down gracefully after the last message is
sent and received.

        let (tx, mut rx) = trpl::channel();

        let tx_fut = async move {
            let vals = vec![
                String::from("hi"),
                String::from("from"),
                String::from("the"),
                String::from("future"),
            ];

            for val in vals {
                tx.send(val).unwrap();
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        };

        let rx_fut = async {
            while let Some(value) = rx.recv().await {
                eprintln!("received '{value}'");
            }
        };

        trpl::join(tx_fut, rx_fut).await;

This async channel is also a multiple-producer channel, so we can call
‘clone’ on ‘tx’ if we want to send messages from multiple futures.  In
Listing 17-13, we clone ‘tx’, creating ‘tx1’ outside the first async
block.  We move ‘tx1’ into that block just as we did before with ‘tx’.
Then, later, we move the original ‘tx’ into a ‘new’ async block, where
we send more messages on a slightly slower delay.  We happen to put this
new async block after the async block for receiving messages, but it
could go before it just as well.  The key is the order of the futures
are awaited in, not the order they are created in.

Both of the async blocks for sending messages need to be ‘async move’
blocks, so that both ‘tx’ and ‘tx1’ get dropped when those blocks
finish.  Otherwise we'll end up back in the same infinite loop we
started out in.  Finally, we switch from ‘trpl::join’ to ‘trpl::join3’
to handle the additional future.

        let (tx, mut rx) = trpl::channel();

        let tx1 = tx.clone();
        let tx1_fut = async move {
            let vals = vec![
                String::from("hi"),
                String::from("from"),
                String::from("the"),
                String::from("future"),
            ];

            for val in vals {
                tx1.send(val).unwrap();
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        };

        let rx_fut = async {
            while let Some(value) = rx.recv().await {
                println!("received '{value}'");
            }
        };

        let tx_fut = async move {
            let vals = vec![
                String::from("more"),
                String::from("messages"),
                String::from("for"),
                String::from("you"),
            ];

            for val in vals {
                tx.send(val).unwrap();
                trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1500)).await;
            }
        };

        trpl::join3(tx1_fut, tx_fut, rx_fut).await;

Now we see all the messages from both sending futures.  Because the
sending futures use slightly different delays after sending, the
messages are also received at those different intervals.

received 'hi'
received 'more'
received 'from'
received 'the'
received 'messages'
received 'future'
received 'for'
received 'you'

This is a good start, but it limits us to just a handful of futures: two
with ‘join’, or three with ‘join3’.  Let's see how we might work with
more futures.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Working With Any Number of Futures,  Next: Streams,  Prev: Concurrency With Async,  Up: Async and Await

19.2.4 Working With Any Number of Futures
-----------------------------------------

When we switched from using two futures to three in the previous
section, we also had to switch from using ‘join’ to using ‘join3’.  It
would be annoying to have to call a different function every time we
changed the number of futures we wanted to join.  Happily, we have a
macro form of ‘join’ to which we can pass an arbitrary number of
arguments.  It also handles awaiting the futures itself.  Thus, we could
rewrite the code from Listing 17-13 to use ‘join!’ instead of ‘join3’,
as in Listing 17-14:

        trpl::join!(tx1_fut, tx_fut, rx_fut);

This is definitely a nice improvement over needing to swap between
‘join’ and ‘join3’ and ‘join4’ and so on!  However, even this macro form
only works when we know the number of futures ahead of time.  In
real-world Rust, though, pushing futures into a collection and then
waiting on some or all the futures in that collection to complete is a
common pattern.

To check all the futures in some collection, we'll need to iterate over
and join on ‘all’ of them.  The ‘trpl::join_all’ function accepts any
type which implements the ‘Iterator’ trait, which we learned about back
in Chapter 13, so it seems like just the ticket.  Let's try putting our
futures in a vector, and replace ‘join!’ with ‘join_all’.

        let futures = vec![tx1_fut, rx_fut, tx_fut];

        trpl::join_all(futures).await;

Unfortunately, this doesn't compile.  Instead, we get this error:

   = help: consider pinning your async block and casting it to a trait object

This might be surprising.  After all, none of them return anything, so
each block produces a ‘Future<Output = ()>’.  However, ‘Future’ is a
trait, not a concrete type.  The concrete types are the individual data
structures generated by the compiler for async blocks.  You can't put
two different hand-written structs in a ‘Vec’, and the same thing
applies to the different structs generated by the compiler.

To make this work, we need to use ‘trait objects’, just as we did in
*note “Returning Errors from the run function”: Refactoring to Improve
Modularity and Error Handling. in Chapter 12.  (We'll cover trait
objects in detail in Chapter 18.)  Using trait objects lets us treat
each of the anonymous futures produced by these types as the same type,
because all of them implement the ‘Future’ trait.

Note: In Chapter 8, we discussed another way to include multiple types
in a ‘Vec’: using an enum to represent each of the different types which
can appear in the vector.  We can't do that here, though.  For one
thing, we have no way to name the different types, because they are
anonymous.  For another, the reason we reached for a vector and
‘join_all’ in the first place was to be able to work with a dynamic
collection of futures where we don't know what they will all be until
runtime.

We start by wrapping each of the futures in the ‘vec!’ in a ‘Box::new’,
as shown in Listing 17-16.

        let futures =
            vec![Box::new(tx1_fut), Box::new(rx_fut), Box::new(tx_fut)];

        trpl::join_all(futures).await;

Unfortunately, this still doesn't compile.  In fact, we have the same
basic error we did before, but we get one for both the second and third
‘Box::new’ calls, and we also get new errors referring to the ‘Unpin’
trait.  We will come back to the ‘Unpin’ errors in a moment.  First,
let's fix the type errors on the ‘Box::new’ calls, by explicitly
annotating the type of the ‘futures’ variable:

        let futures: Vec<Box<dyn Future<Output = ()>>> =
            vec![Box::new(tx1_fut), Box::new(rx_fut), Box::new(tx_fut)];

The type we had to write here is a little involved, so let's walk
through it:

   • The innermost type is the future itself.  We note explicitly that
     the output of the future is the unit type ‘()’ by writing
     ‘Future<Output = ()>’.
   • Then we annotate the trait with ‘dyn’ to mark it as dynamic.
   • The entire trait reference is wrapped in a ‘Box’.
   • Finally, we state explicitly that ‘futures’ is a ‘Vec’ containing
     these items.

That already made a big difference.  Now when we run the compiler, we
only have the errors mentioning ‘Unpin’.  Although there are three of
them, notice that each is very similar in its contents.

That is a ‘lot’ to digest, so let's pull it apart.  The first part of
the message tell us that the first async block (‘src/main.rs:8:23:
20:10’) does not implement the ‘Unpin’ trait, and suggests using ‘pin!’
or ‘Box::pin’ to resolve it.  Later in the chapter, we'll dig into a few
more details about ‘Pin’ and ‘Unpin’.  For the moment, though, we can
just follow the compiler's advice to get unstuck!  In Listing 17-18, we
start by updating the type annotation for ‘futures’, with a ‘Pin’
wrapping each ‘Box’.  Second, we use ‘Box::pin’ to pin the futures
themselves.

        let futures: Vec<Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = ()>>>> =
            vec![Box::pin(tx1_fut), Box::pin(rx_fut), Box::pin(tx_fut)];

If we compile and run this, we finally get the output we hoped for:

received 'hi'
received 'more'
received 'from'
received 'messages'
received 'the'
received 'for'
received 'future'
received 'you'

Phew!

There's a bit more we can explore here.  For one thing, using
‘Pin<Box<T>>’ comes with a small amount of extra overhead from putting
these futures on the heap with ‘Box’--and we're only doing that to get
the types to line up.  We don't actually ‘need’ the heap allocation,
after all: these futures are local to this particular function.  As
noted above, ‘Pin’ is itself a wrapper type, so we can get the benefit
of having a single type in the ‘Vec’--the original reason we reached for
‘Box’--without doing a heap allocation.  We can use ‘Pin’ directly with
each future, using the ‘std::pin::pin’ macro.

However, we must still be explicit about the type of the pinned
reference; otherwise Rust will still not know to interpret these as
dynamic trait objects, which is what we need them to be in the ‘Vec’.
We therefore ‘pin!’ each future when we define it, and define ‘futures’
as a ‘Vec’ containing pinned mutable references to the dynamic ‘Future’
type, as in Listing 17-19.

        let tx1_fut = pin!(async move {
            // --snip--
        });

        let rx_fut = pin!(async {
            // --snip--
        });

        let tx_fut = pin!(async move {
            // --snip--
        });

        let futures: Vec<Pin<&mut dyn Future<Output = ()>>> =
            vec![tx1_fut, rx_fut, tx_fut];

We got this far by ignoring the fact that we might have different
‘Output’ types.  For example, in Listing 17-20, the anonymous future for
‘a’ implements ‘Future<Output = u32>’, the anonymous future for ‘b’
implements ‘Future<Output = &str>’, and the anonymous future for ‘c’
implements ‘Future<Output = bool>’.

        let a = async { 1u32 };
        let b = async { "Hello!" };
        let c = async { true };

        let (a_result, b_result, c_result) = trpl::join!(a, b, c);
        println!("{a_result}, {b_result}, {c_result}");

We can use ‘trpl::join!’ to await them, because it allows you to pass in
multiple future types and produces a tuple of those types.  We ‘cannot’
use ‘trpl::join_all’, because it requires the futures passed in all to
have the same type.  Remember, that error is what got us started on this
adventure with ‘Pin’!

This is a fundamental tradeoff: we can either deal with a dynamic number
of futures with ‘join_all’, as long as they all have the same type, or
we can deal with a set number of futures with the ‘join’ functions or
the ‘join!’ macro, even if they have different types.  This is the same
as working with any other types in Rust, though.  Futures are not
special, even though we have some nice syntax for working with them, and
that is a good thing.

19.2.4.1 Racing futures
.......................

When we “join” futures with the ‘join’ family of functions and macros,
we require ‘all’ of them to finish before we move on.  Sometimes,
though, we only need ‘some’ future from a set to finish before we move
on--kind of similar to racing one future against another.

In Listing 17-21, we once again use ‘trpl::race’ to run two futures,
‘slow’ and ‘fast’, against each other.  Each one prints a message when
it starts running, pauses for some amount of time by calling and
awaiting ‘sleep’, and then prints another message when it finishes.
Then we pass both to ‘trpl::race’ and wait for one of them to finish.
(The outcome here won't be too surprising: ‘fast’ wins!)  Unlike when we
used ‘race’ back in *note “Our First Async Program”: Our First Async
Program, we just ignore the ‘Either’ instance it returns here, because
all of the interesting behavior happens in the body of the async blocks.

        let slow = async {
            println!("'slow' started.");
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
            println!("'slow' finished.");
        };

        let fast = async {
            println!("'fast' started.");
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
            println!("'fast' finished.");
        };

        trpl::race(slow, fast).await;

Notice that if you flip the order of the arguments to ‘race’, the order
of the “started” messages changes, even though the ‘fast’ future always
completes first.  That's because the implementation of this particular
‘race’ function is not fair.  It always runs the futures passed as
arguments in the order they're passed.  Other implementations ‘are’
fair, and will randomly choose which future to poll first.  Regardless
of whether the implementation of race we're using is fair, though, ‘one’
of the futures will run up to the first ‘await’ in its body before
another task can start.

Recall from *note Our First Async Program: Our First Async Program. that
at each await point, Rust gives a runtime a chance to pause the task and
switch to another one if the future being awaited isn't ready.  The
inverse is also true: Rust ‘only’ pauses async blocks and hands control
back to a runtime at an await point.  Everything between await points is
synchronous.

That means if you do a bunch of work in an async block without an await
point, that future will block any other futures from making progress.
You may sometimes hear this referred to as one future ‘starving’ other
futures.  In some cases, that may not be a big deal.  However, if you
are doing some kind of expensive setup or long-running work, or if you
have a future which will keep doing some particular task indefinitely,
you'll need to think about when and where to hand control back to the
runtime.

By the same token, if you have long-running blocking operations, async
can be a useful tool for providing ways for different parts of the
program to relate to each other.

But ‘how’ would you hand control back to the runtime in those cases?


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Yielding,  Next: Building Our Own Async Abstractions,  Prev: Racing futures,  Up: Working With Any Number of Futures

19.2.4.2 Yielding
.................

Let's simulate a long-running operation.  Listing 17-22 introduces a
‘slow’ function.  It uses ‘std::thread::sleep’ instead of ‘trpl::sleep’
so that calling ‘slow’ will block the current thread for some number of
milliseconds.  We can use ‘slow’ to stand in for real-world operations
which are both long-running and blocking.

fn slow(name: &str, ms: u64) {
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(ms));
    println!("'{name}' ran for {ms}ms");
}

In Listing 17-23, we use ‘slow’ to emulate doing this kind of CPU-bound
work in a pair of futures.  To begin, each future only hands control
back to the runtime ‘after’ carrying out a bunch of slow operations.

        let a = async {
            println!("'a' started.");
            slow("a", 30);
            slow("a", 10);
            slow("a", 20);
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
            println!("'a' finished.");
        };

        let b = async {
            println!("'b' started.");
            slow("b", 75);
            slow("b", 10);
            slow("b", 15);
            slow("b", 350);
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
            println!("'b' finished.");
        };

        trpl::race(a, b).await;

If you run this, you will see this output:

'a' started.
'a' ran for 30ms
'a' ran for 10ms
'a' ran for 20ms
'b' started.
'b' ran for 75ms
'b' ran for 10ms
'b' ran for 15ms
'b' ran for 350ms
'a' finished.

As with our earlier example, ‘race’ still finishes as soon as ‘a’ is
done.  There's no interleaving between the two futures, though.  The ‘a’
future does all of its work until the ‘trpl::sleep’ call is awaited,
then the ‘b’ future does all of its work until its own ‘trpl::sleep’
call is awaited, and then the ‘a’ future completes.  To allow both
futures to make progress between their slow tasks, we need await points
so we can hand control back to the runtime.  That means we need
something we can await!

We can already see this kind of handoff happening in Listing 17-23: if
we removed the ‘trpl::sleep’ at the end of the ‘a’ future, it would
complete without the ‘b’ future running ‘at all’.  Maybe we could use
the ‘sleep’ function as a starting point?

        let one_ms = Duration::from_millis(1);

        let a = async {
            println!("'a' started.");
            slow("a", 30);
            trpl::sleep(one_ms).await;
            slow("a", 10);
            trpl::sleep(one_ms).await;
            slow("a", 20);
            trpl::sleep(one_ms).await;
            println!("'a' finished.");
        };

        let b = async {
            println!("'b' started.");
            slow("b", 75);
            trpl::sleep(one_ms).await;
            slow("b", 10);
            trpl::sleep(one_ms).await;
            slow("b", 15);
            trpl::sleep(one_ms).await;
            slow("b", 35);
            trpl::sleep(one_ms).await;
            println!("'b' finished.");
        };

In Listing 17-24, we add ‘trpl::sleep’ calls with await points between
each call to ‘slow’.  Now the two futures' work is interleaved:

'a' started.
'a' ran for 30ms
'b' started.
'b' ran for 75ms
'a' ran for 10ms
'b' ran for 10ms
'a' ran for 20ms
'b' ran for 15ms
'a' finished.

The ‘a’ future still runs for a bit before handing off control to ‘b’,
because it calls ‘slow’ before ever calling ‘trpl::sleep’, but after
that the futures swap back and forth each time one of them hits an await
point.  In this case, we have done that after every call to ‘slow’, but
we could break up the work however makes the most sense to us.

We don't really want to ‘sleep’ here, though: we want to make progress
as fast as we can.  We just need to hand back control to the runtime.
We can do that directly, using the ‘yield_now’ function.  In Listing
17-25, we replace all those ‘sleep’ calls with ‘yield_now’.

        let a = async {
            println!("'a' started.");
            slow("a", 30);
            trpl::yield_now().await;
            slow("a", 10);
            trpl::yield_now().await;
            slow("a", 20);
            trpl::yield_now().await;
            println!("'a' finished.");
        };

        let b = async {
            println!("'b' started.");
            slow("b", 75);
            trpl::yield_now().await;
            slow("b", 10);
            trpl::yield_now().await;
            slow("b", 15);
            trpl::yield_now().await;
            slow("b", 35);
            trpl::yield_now().await;
            println!("'b' finished.");
        };

This is both clearer about the actual intent and can be significantly
faster than using ‘sleep’, because timers such as the one used by
‘sleep’ often have limits to how granular they can be.  The version of
‘sleep’ we are using, for example, will always sleep for at least a
millisecond, even if we pass it a ‘Duration’ of one nanosecond.  Again,
modern computers are ‘fast’: they can do a lot in one millisecond!

You can see this for yourself by setting up a little benchmark, such as
the one in Listing 17-26.  (This isn't an especially rigorous way to do
performance testing, but it suffices to show the difference here.)
Here, we skip all the status printing, pass a one-nanosecond ‘Duration’
to ‘trpl::sleep’, and let each future run by itself, with no switching
between the futures.  Then we run for 1,000 iterations and see how long
the future using ‘trpl::sleep’ takes compared to the future using
‘trpl::yield_now’.

        let one_ns = Duration::from_nanos(1);
        let start = Instant::now();
        async {
            for _ in 1..1000 {
                trpl::sleep(one_ns).await;
            }
        }
        .await;
        let time = Instant::now() - start;
        println!(
            "'sleep' version finished after {} seconds.",
            time.as_secs_f32()
        );

        let start = Instant::now();
        async {
            for _ in 1..1000 {
                trpl::yield_now().await;
            }
        }
        .await;
        let time = Instant::now() - start;
        println!(
            "'yield' version finished after {} seconds.",
            time.as_secs_f32()
        );

The version with ‘yield_now’ is ‘way’ faster!

This means that async can be useful even for compute-bound tasks,
depending on what else your program is doing, because it provides a
useful tool for structuring the relationships between different parts of
the program.  This is a form of ‘cooperative multitasking’, where each
future has the power to determine when it hands over control via await
points.  Each future therefore also has the responsibility to avoid
blocking for too long.  In some Rust-based embedded operating systems,
this is the ‘only’ kind of multitasking!

In real-world code, you won't usually be alternating function calls with
await points on every single line, of course.  While yielding control in
this way is relatively inexpensive, it's not free!  In many cases,
trying to break up a compute-bound task might make it significantly
slower, so sometimes it's better for ‘overall’ performance to let an
operation block briefly.  You should always measure to see what your
code's actual performance bottlenecks are.  The underlying dynamic is an
important one to keep in mind if you ‘are’ seeing a lot of work
happening in serial that you expected to happen concurrently, though!

19.2.4.3 Building Our Own Async Abstractions
............................................

We can also compose futures together to create new patterns.  For
example, we can build a ‘timeout’ function with async building blocks we
already have.  When we're done, the result will be another building
block we could use to build up yet further async abstractions.

Listing 17-27 shows how we would expect this ‘timeout’ to work with a
slow future.

        let slow = async {
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
            "I finished!"
        };

        match timeout(slow, Duration::from_millis(10)).await {
            Ok(message) => println!("Succeeded with '{message}'"),
            Err(duration) => {
                println!("Failed after {} seconds", duration.as_secs())
            }
        }

Let's implement this!  To begin, let's think about the API for
‘timeout’:

   • It needs to be an async function itself so we can await it.
   • Its first parameter should be a future to run.  We can make it
     generic to allow it to work with any future.
   • Its second parameter will be the maximum time to wait.  If we use a
     ‘Duration’, that will make it easy to pass along to ‘trpl::sleep’.
   • It should return a ‘Result’.  If the future completes successfully,
     the ‘Result’ will be ‘Ok’ with the value produced by the future.
     If the timeout elapses first, the ‘Result’ will be ‘Err’ with the
     duration that the timeout waited for.

Listing 17-28 shows this declaration.

async fn timeout<F: Future>(
    future_to_try: F,
    max_time: Duration,
) -> Result<F::Output, Duration> {
    // Here is where our implementation will go!
}

That satisfies our goals for the types.  Now let's think about the
‘behavior’ we need: we want to race the future passed in against the
duration.  We can use ‘trpl::sleep’ to make a timer future from the
duration, and use ‘trpl::race’ to run that timer with the future the
caller passes in.

We also know that ‘race’ is not fair, and polls arguments in the order
they are passed.  Thus, we pass ‘future_to_try’ to ‘race’ first so it
gets a chance to complete even if ‘max_time’ is a very short duration.
If ‘future_to_try’ finishes first, ‘race’ will return ‘Left’ with the
output from ‘future’.  If ‘timer’ finishes first, ‘race’ will return
‘Right’ with the timer's output of ‘()’.

In Listing 17-29, we match on the result of awaiting ‘trpl::race’.  If
the ‘future_to_try’ succeeded and we get a ‘Left(output)’, we return
‘Ok(output)’.  If the sleep timer elapsed instead and we get a
‘Right(())’, we ignore the ‘()’ with ‘_’ and return ‘Err(max_time)’
instead.

use trpl::Either;

// --snip--

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let slow = async {
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
            "Finally finished"
        };

        match timeout(slow, Duration::from_secs(2)).await {
            Ok(message) => println!("Succeeded with '{message}'"),
            Err(duration) => {
                println!("Failed after {} seconds", duration.as_secs())
            }
        }
    });
}

async fn timeout<F: Future>(
    future_to_try: F,
    max_time: Duration,
) -> Result<F::Output, Duration> {
    match trpl::race(future_to_try, trpl::sleep(max_time)).await {
        Either::Left(output) => Ok(output),
        Either::Right(_) => Err(max_time),
    }

With that, we have a working ‘timeout’, built out of two other async
helpers.  If we run our code, it will print the failure mode after the
timeout:

Failed after 2 seconds

Because futures compose with other futures, you can build really
powerful tools using smaller async building blocks.  For example, you
can use this same approach to combine timeouts with retries, and in turn
use those with things such as network calls--one of the examples from
the beginning of the chapter!

In practice, you will usually work directly with ‘async’ and ‘await’,
and secondarily with functions and macros such as ‘join’, ‘join_all’,
‘race’, and so on.  You'll only need to reach for ‘pin’ now and again to
use them with those APIs.

We've now seen a number of ways to work with multiple futures at the
same time.  Up next, we'll look at how we can work with multiple futures
in a sequence over time, with ‘streams’.  Here are a couple more things
you might want to consider first, though:

   • We used a ‘Vec’ with ‘join_all’ to wait for all of the futures in
     some group to finish.  How could you use a ‘Vec’ to process a group
     of futures in sequence, instead?  What are the tradeoffs of doing
     that?

   • Take a look at the ‘futures::stream::FuturesUnordered’ type from
     the ‘futures’ crate.  How would using it be different from using a
     ‘Vec’?  (Don't worry about the fact that it is from the ‘stream’
     part of the crate; it works just fine with any collection of
     futures.)

19.2.5 Streams
--------------

So far in this chapter, we have mostly stuck to individual futures.  The
one big exception was the async channel we used.  Recall how we used the
receiver for our async channel in the *note “Message Passing”: Message
Passing. earlier in the chapter.  The async ‘recv’ method produces a
sequence of items over time.  This is an instance of a much more general
pattern, often called a ‘stream’.

A sequence of items is something we've seen before, when we looked at
the ‘Iterator’ trait in Chapter 13.  There are two differences between
iterators and the async channel receiver, though.  The first is the
element of time: iterators are synchronous, while the channel receiver
is asynchronous.  The second is the API. When working directly with an
‘Iterator’, we call its synchronous ‘next’ method.  With the
‘trpl::Receiver’ stream in particular, we called an asynchronous ‘recv’
method instead.  These APIs otherwise feel very similar.

That similarity isn't a coincidence.  A stream is similar to an
asynchronous form of iteration.  Whereas the ‘trpl::Receiver’
specifically waits to receive messages, though, the general-purpose
stream API is much more general: it provides the next item the way
‘Iterator’ does, but asynchronously.  The similarity between iterators
and streams in Rust means we can actually create a stream from any
iterator.  As with an iterator, we can work with a stream by calling its
‘next’ method and then awaiting the output, as in Listing 17-30.

        let values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
        let iter = values.iter().map(|n| n * 2);
        let mut stream = trpl::stream_from_iter(iter);

        while let Some(value) = stream.next().await {
            println!("The value was: {value}");
        }

We start with an array of numbers, which we convert to an iterator and
then call ‘map’ on to double all the values.  Then we convert the
iterator into a stream using the ‘trpl::stream_from_iter’ function.
Then we loop over the items in the stream as they arrive with the ‘while
let’ loop.

Unfortunately, when we try to run the code, it doesn't compile.
Instead, as we can see in the output, it reports that there is no ‘next’
method available.

As the output suggests, the reason for the compiler error is that we
need the right trait in scope to be able to use the ‘next’ method.
Given our discussion so far, you might reasonably expect that to be
‘Stream’, but the trait we need here is actually ‘StreamExt’.  The ‘Ext’
there is for “extension”: this is a common pattern in the Rust community
for extending one trait with another.

Why do we need ‘StreamExt’ instead of ‘Stream’, and what does the
‘Stream’ trait itself do?  Briefly, the answer is that throughout the
Rust ecosystem, the ‘Stream’ trait defines a low-level interface which
effectively combines the ‘Iterator’ and ‘Future’ traits.  The
‘StreamExt’ trait supplies a higher-level set of APIs on top of
‘Stream’, including the ‘next’ method as well as other utility methods
similar to those provided by the ‘Iterator’ trait.  We'll return to the
‘Stream’ and ‘StreamExt’ traits in a bit more detail at the end of the
chapter.  For now, this is enough to let us keep moving.

The fix to the compiler error is to add a ‘use’ statement for
‘trpl::StreamExt’, as in Listing 17-31.

use trpl::StreamExt;

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
        let iter = values.iter().map(|n| n * 2);
        let mut stream = trpl::stream_from_iter(iter);

        while let Some(value) = stream.next().await {
            println!("The value was: {value}");
        }
    });
}

With all those pieces put together, this code works the way we want!
What's more, now that we have ‘StreamExt’ in scope, we can use all of
its utility methods, just as with iterators.  For example, in Listing
17-32, we use the ‘filter’ method to filter out everything but multiples
of three and five.

use trpl::StreamExt;

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let values = 1..101;
        let iter = values.map(|n| n * 2);
        let stream = trpl::stream_from_iter(iter);

        let mut filtered =
            stream.filter(|value| value % 3 == 0 || value % 5 == 0);

        while let Some(value) = filtered.next().await {
            println!("The value was: {value}");
        }
    });
}

Of course, this isn't very interesting.  We could do that with normal
iterators and without any async at all.  So let's look at some of the
other things we can do which are unique to streams.

* Menu:

* Composing Streams::
* Merging Streams::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Composing Streams,  Next: Merging Streams,  Prev: Streams,  Up: Streams

19.2.5.1 Composing Streams
..........................

Many concepts are naturally represented as streams: items becoming
available in a queue, or working with more data than can fit in a
computer's memory by only pulling chunks of it from the file system at a
time, or data arriving over the network over time.  Because streams are
futures, we can use them with any other kind of future, too, and we can
combine them in interesting ways.  For example, we can batch up events
to avoid triggering too many network calls, set timeouts on sequences of
long-running operations, or throttle user interface events to avoid
doing needless work.

Let's start by building a little stream of messages, as a stand-in for a
stream of data we might see from a WebSocket or another real-time
communication protocol.  In Listing 17-33, we create a function
‘get_messages’ which returns ‘impl Stream<Item = String>’.  For its
implementation, we create an async channel, loop over the first ten
letters of the English alphabet, and send them across the channel.

We also use a new type: ‘ReceiverStream’, which converts the ‘rx’
receiver from the ‘trpl::channel’ into a ‘Stream’ with a ‘next’ method.
Back in ‘main’, we use a ‘while let’ loop to print all the messages from
the stream.

use trpl::{ReceiverStream, Stream, StreamExt};

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let mut messages = get_messages();

        while let Some(message) = messages.next().await {
            println!("{message}");
        }
    });
}

fn get_messages() -> impl Stream<Item = String> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    let messages = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"];
    for message in messages {
        tx.send(format!("Message: '{message}'")).unwrap();
    }

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}

When we run this code, we get exactly the results we would expect:

Message: 'a'
Message: 'b'
Message: 'c'
Message: 'd'
Message: 'e'
Message: 'f'
Message: 'g'
Message: 'h'
Message: 'i'
Message: 'j'

We could do this with the regular ‘Receiver’ API, or even the regular
‘Iterator’ API, though.  Let's add something that requires streams:
adding a timeout which applies to every item in the stream, and a delay
on the items we emit.

In Listing 17-34, we start by adding a timeout to the stream with the
‘timeout’ method, which comes from the ‘StreamExt’ trait.  Then we
update the body of the ‘while let’ loop, because the stream now returns
a ‘Result’.  The ‘Ok’ variant indicates a message arrived in time; the
‘Err’ variant indicates that the timeout elapsed before any message
arrived.  We ‘match’ on that result and either print the message when we
receive it successfully, or print a notice about the timeout.  Finally,
notice that we pin the messages after applying the timeout to them,
because the timeout helper produces a stream which needs to be pinned to
be polled.

use std::{pin::pin, time::Duration};
use trpl::{ReceiverStream, Stream, StreamExt};

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let mut messages =
            pin!(get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200)));

        while let Some(result) = messages.next().await {
            match result {
                Ok(message) => println!("{message}"),
                Err(reason) => eprintln!("Problem: {reason:?}"),
            }
        }
    })
}

However, because there are no delays between messages, this timeout does
not change the behavior of the program.  Let's add a variable delay to
the messages we send.  In ‘get_messages’, we use the ‘enumerate’
iterator method with the ‘messages’ array so that we can get the index
of each item we are sending along with the item itself.  Then we apply a
100 millisecond delay to even-index items and a 300 millisecond delay to
odd-index items, to simulate the different delays we might see from a
stream of messages in the real world.  Because our timeout is for 200
milliseconds, this should affect half of the messages.

fn get_messages() -> impl Stream<Item = String> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let messages = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"];
        for (index, message) in messages.into_iter().enumerate() {
            let time_to_sleep = if index % 2 == 0 { 100 } else { 300 };
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(time_to_sleep)).await;

            tx.send(format!("Message: '{message}'")).unwrap();
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}

To sleep between messages in the ‘get_messages’ function without
blocking, we need to use async.  However, we can't make ‘get_messages’
itself into an async function, because then we'd return a ‘Future<Output
= Stream<Item = String>>’ instead of a ‘Stream<Item = String>>’.  The
caller would have to await ‘get_messages’ itself to get access to the
stream.  But remember: everything in a given future happens linearly;
concurrency happens ‘between’ futures.  Awaiting ‘get_messages’ would
require it to send all the messages, including sleeping between sending
each message, before returning the receiver stream.  As a result, the
timeout would end up useless.  There would be no delays in the stream
itself: the delays would all happen before the stream was even
available.

Instead, we leave ‘get_messages’ as a regular function which returns a
stream, and spawn a task to handle the async ‘sleep’ calls.

Note: calling ‘spawn_task’ in this way works because we already set up
our runtime.  Calling this particular implementation of ‘spawn_task’
‘without’ first setting up a runtime will cause a panic.  Other
implementations choose different tradeoffs: they might spawn a new
runtime and so avoid the panic but end up with a bit of extra overhead,
or simply not provide a standalone way to spawn tasks without reference
to a runtime.  You should make sure you know what tradeoff your runtime
has chosen and write your code accordingly!

Now our code has a much more interesting result!  Between every other
pair of messages, we see an error reported: ‘Problem: Elapsed(())’.

Message: 'a'
Problem: Elapsed(())
Message: 'b'
Message: 'c'
Problem: Elapsed(())
Message: 'd'
Message: 'e'
Problem: Elapsed(())
Message: 'f'
Message: 'g'
Problem: Elapsed(())
Message: 'h'
Message: 'i'
Problem: Elapsed(())
Message: 'j'

The timeout doesn't prevent the messages from arriving in the end--we
still get all of the original messages.  This is because our channel is
unbounded: it can hold as many messages as we can fit in memory.  If the
message doesn't arrive before the timeout, our stream handler will
account for that, but when it polls the stream again, the message may
now have arrived.

You can get different behavior if needed by using other kinds of
channels, or other kinds of streams more generally.  Let's see one of
those in practice in our final example for this section, by combining a
stream of time intervals with this stream of messages.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Merging Streams,  Next: Digging Into the Traits for Async,  Prev: Composing Streams,  Up: Streams

19.2.5.2 Merging Streams
........................

First, let's create another stream, which will emit an item every
millisecond if we let it run directly.  For simplicity, we can use the
‘sleep’ function to send a message on a delay, and combine it with the
same approach of creating a stream from a channel we used in
‘get_messages’.  The difference is that this time, we're going to send
back the count of intervals which has elapsed, so the return type will
be ‘impl Stream<Item = u32>’, and we can call the function
‘get_intervals’.

In Listing 17-36, we start by defining a ‘count’ in the task.  (We could
define it outside the task, too, but it is clearer to limit the scope of
any given variable.)  Then we create an infinite loop.  Each iteration
of the loop asynchronously sleeps for one millisecond, increments the
count, and then sends it over the channel.  Because this is all wrapped
in the task created by ‘spawn_task’, all of it will get cleaned up along
with the runtime, including the infinite loop.

fn get_intervals() -> impl Stream<Item = u32> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let mut count = 0;
        loop {
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1)).await;
            count += 1;
            tx.send(count).unwrap();
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}

This kind of infinite loop, which only ends when the whole runtime gets
torn down, is fairly common in async Rust: many programs need to keep
running indefinitely.  With async, this doesn't block anything else, as
long as there is at least one await point in each iteration through the
loop.

Back in our main function's async block, we start by calling
‘get_intervals’.  Then we merge the ‘messages’ and ‘intervals’ streams
with the ‘merge’ method, which combines multiple streams into one stream
that produces items from any of the source streams as soon as the items
are available, without imposing any particular ordering.  Finally, we
loop over that combined stream instead of over ‘messages’ (Listing
17-37).

        let messages = get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200));
        let intervals = get_intervals();
        let merged = messages.merge(intervals);

At this point, neither ‘messages’ nor ‘intervals’ needs to be pinned or
mutable, because both will be combined into the single ‘merged’ stream.
However, this call to ‘merge’ does not compile!  (Neither does the
‘next’ call in the ‘while let’ loop, but we'll come back to that after
fixing this.)  The two streams have different types.  The ‘messages’
stream has the type ‘Timeout<impl Stream<Item = String>>’, where
‘Timeout’ is the type which implements ‘Stream’ for a ‘timeout’ call.
Meanwhile, the ‘intervals’ stream has the type ‘impl Stream<Item =
u32>’.  To merge these two streams, we need to transform one of them to
match the other.

In Listing 17-38, we rework the ‘intervals’ stream, because ‘messages’
is already in the basic format we want and has to handle timeout errors.
First, we can use the ‘map’ helper method to transform the ‘intervals’
into a string.  Second, we need to match the ‘Timeout’ from ‘messages’.
Because we don't actually ‘want’ a timeout for ‘intervals’, though, we
can just create a timeout which is longer than the other durations we
are using.  Here, we create a 10-second timeout with
‘Duration::from_secs(10)’.  Finally, we need to make ‘stream’ mutable,
so that the ‘while let’ loop's ‘next’ calls can iterate through the
stream, and pin it so that it's safe to do so.

        let messages = get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200));
        let intervals = get_intervals()
            .map(|count| format!("Interval: {count}"))
            .timeout(Duration::from_secs(10));
        let merged = messages.merge(intervals);
        let mut stream = pin!(merged);

That gets us ‘almost’ to where we need to be.  Everything type checks.
If you run this, though, there will be two problems.  First, it will
never stop!  You'll need to stop it with ctrl-c.  Second, the messages
from the English alphabet will be buried in the midst of all the
interval counter messages:

--snip--
Interval: 38
Interval: 39
Interval: 40
Message: 'a'
Interval: 41
Interval: 42
Interval: 43
--snip--

Listing 17-39 shows one way to solve these last two problems.  First, we
use the ‘throttle’ method on the ‘intervals’ stream, so that it doesn't
overwhelm the ‘messages’ stream.  Throttling is a way of limiting the
rate at which a function will be called--or, in this case, how often the
stream will be polled.  Once every hundred milliseconds should do,
because that is in the same ballpark as how often our messages arrive.

To limit the number of items we will accept from a stream, we can use
the ‘take’ method.  We apply it to the ‘merged’ stream, because we want
to limit the final output, not just one stream or the other.

        let messages = get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200));
        let intervals = get_intervals()
            .map(|count| format!("Interval: {count}"))
            .throttle(Duration::from_millis(100))
            .timeout(Duration::from_secs(10));
        let merged = messages.merge(intervals).take(20);
        let mut stream = pin!(merged);

Now when we run the program, it stops after pulling twenty items from
the stream, and the intervals don't overwhelm the messages.  We also
don't get ‘Interval: 100’ or ‘Interval: 200’ or so on, but instead get
‘Interval: 1’, ‘Interval: 2’, and so on--even though we have a source
stream which ‘can’ produce an event every millisecond.  That's because
the ‘throttle’ call produces a new stream, wrapping the original stream,
so that the original stream only gets polled at the throttle rate, not
its own “native” rate.  We don't have a bunch of unhandled interval
messages we're choosing to ignore.  Instead, we never produce those
interval messages in the first place!  This is the inherent “laziness”
of Rust's futures at work again, allowing us to choose our performance
characteristics.

Interval: 1
Message: 'a'
Interval: 2
Interval: 3
Problem: Elapsed(())
Interval: 4
Message: 'b'
Interval: 5
Message: 'c'
Interval: 6
Interval: 7
Problem: Elapsed(())
Interval: 8
Message: 'd'
Interval: 9
Message: 'e'
Interval: 10
Interval: 11
Problem: Elapsed(())
Interval: 12

There's one last thing we need to handle: errors!  With both of these
channel-based streams, the ‘send’ calls could fail when the other side
of the channel closes--and that's just a matter of how the runtime
executes the futures which make up the stream.  Up until now we have
ignored this by calling ‘unwrap’, but in a well-behaved app, we should
explicitly handle the error, at minimum by ending the loop so we don't
try to send any more messages!  Listing 17-40 shows a simple error
strategy: print the issue and then ‘break’ from the loops.  As usual,
the correct way to handle a message send error will vary--just make sure
you have a strategy.

fn get_messages() -> impl Stream<Item = String> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let messages = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"];

        for (index, message) in messages.into_iter().enumerate() {
            let time_to_sleep = if index % 2 == 0 { 100 } else { 300 };
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(time_to_sleep)).await;

            if let Err(send_error) = tx.send(format!("Message: '{message}'")) {
                eprintln!("Cannot send message '{message}': {send_error}");
                break;
            }
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}

fn get_intervals() -> impl Stream<Item = u32> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let mut count = 0;
        loop {
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1)).await;
            count += 1;

            if let Err(send_error) = tx.send(count) {
                eprintln!("Could not send interval {count}: {send_error}");
                break;
            };
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}

Now that we've seen a bunch of async in practice, let's take a step back
and dig into a few of the details of how ‘Future’, ‘Stream’, and the
other key traits which Rust uses to make async work.

19.2.6 Digging Into the Traits for Async
----------------------------------------

Throughout the chapter, we've used the ‘Future’, ‘Pin’, ‘Unpin’,
‘Stream’, and ‘StreamExt’ traits in various ways.  So far, though, we've
avoided digging too far into the details of how they work or how they
fit together.  Much of the time when writing Rust day to day, this is
fine.  Sometimes, though, you'll hit situations where understanding a
few more of these details matters.  In this section, we'll dig down
‘enough’ further to help with those situations--while still leaving the
‘really’ deep dive for other documentation!

19.2.6.1 Future
...............

Back in *note “Futures and the Async Syntax”: Futures and the Async
Syntax, we noted that ‘Future’ is a trait.  Let's start by taking a
closer look at how it works.  Here is how Rust defines a ‘Future’:

use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}

That trait definition includes a bunch of new types and also some syntax
we haven't seen before, so let's walk through the definition piece by
piece.

First, ‘Future’'s associated type ‘Output’ says what the future resolves
to.  This is analogous to the ‘Item’ associated type for the ‘Iterator’
trait.  Second, ‘Future’ also has the ‘poll’ method, which takes a
special ‘Pin’ reference for its ‘self’ parameter and a mutable reference
to a ‘Context’ type, and returns a ‘Poll<Self::Output>’.  We'll talk a
little more about ‘Pin’ and ‘Context’ later in the section.  For now,
let's focus on what the method returns, the ‘Poll’ type:

enum Poll<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending,
}

This ‘Poll’ type is similar to an ‘Option’: it has one variant which has
a value (‘Ready(T)’), and one which does not (‘Pending’).  It means
something quite different, though!  The ‘Pending’ variant indicates that
the future still has work to do, so the caller will need to check again
later.  The ‘Ready’ variant indicates that the ‘Future’ has finished its
work and the ‘T’ value is available.

Note: With most futures, the caller should not call ‘poll’ again after
the future has returned ‘Ready’.  Many futures will panic if polled
again after becoming ready!  Futures which are safe to poll again will
say so explicitly in their documentation.  This is similar to how
‘Iterator::next’ behaves!

Under the hood, when you see code which uses ‘await’, Rust compiles that
to code which calls ‘poll’.  If you look back at Listing 17-4, where we
printed out the page title for a single URL once it resolved, Rust
compiles it into something kind of (although not exactly) like this:

match page_title(url).poll() {
    Ready(page_title) => match page_title {
        Some(title) => println!("The title for {url} was {title}"),
        None => println!("{url} had no title"),
    }
    Pending => {
        // But what goes here?
    }
}

What should we do when the ‘Future’ is still ‘Pending’?  We need some
way to try again... and again, and again, until the future is finally
ready.  In other words, a loop:

let mut page_title_fut = page_title(url);
loop {
    match page_title_fut.poll() {
        Ready(value) => match page_title {
            Some(title) => println!("The title for {url} was {title}"),
            None => println!("{url} had no title"),
        }
        Pending => {
            // continue
        }
    }
}

If Rust compiled it to exactly that code, though, every ‘await’ would be
blocking--exactly the opposite of what we were going for!  Instead, Rust
makes sure that the loop can hand off control to something which can
pause work on this future and work on other futures and check this one
again later.  That “something” is an async runtime, and this scheduling
and coordination work is one of the main jobs for a runtime.

Recall our description (in the *note Counting: Concurrency With Async.
section) of waiting on ‘rx.recv’.  The ‘recv’ call returns a ‘Future’,
and awaiting it polls it.  In our initial discussion, we noted that a
runtime will pause the future until it's ready with either
‘Some(message)’ or ‘None’ when the channel closes.  With our deeper
understanding of ‘Future’ in place, and specifically ‘Future::poll’, we
can see how that works.  The runtime knows the future isn't ready when
it returns ‘Poll::Pending’.  Conversely, the runtime knows the future is
ready and advances it when ‘poll’ returns ‘Poll::Ready(Some(message))’
or ‘Poll::Ready(None)’.

The exact details of how a runtime does that are more than we will cover
in even this deep dive section.  The key here is to see the basic
mechanic of futures: a runtime ‘polls’ each future it is responsible
for, putting it back to sleep when it is not yet ready.

19.2.6.2 Pinning and the Pin and Unpin Traits
.............................................

When we introduced the idea of pinning while working on Listing 17-16,
we ran into a very gnarly error message.  Here is the relevant part of
it again:

error[E0277]: `{async block@src/main.rs:10:23: 10:33}` cannot be unpinned
  --> src/main.rs:48:33

28 | where
29 |     F: Future,
   |        ^^^^^^ required by this bound in `JoinAll`

When we read this error message carefully, it not only tells us that we
need to pin the values, but also tells us why pinning is required.  The
‘trpl::join_all’ function returns a struct called ‘JoinAll’.  That
struct is generic over a type ‘F’, which is constrained to implement the
‘Future’ trait.  Directly awaiting a future with ‘await’ pins the future
implicitly.  That's why we don't need to use ‘pin!’ everywhere we want
to await futures.

However, we're not directly awaiting a future here.  Instead, we
construct a new future, ‘JoinAll’, by passing a collection of futures to
the ‘join_all’ function.  The signature for ‘join_all’ requires that the
type of the items in the collection all implement the ‘Future’ trait,
and ‘Box<T>’ only implements ‘Future’ if the ‘T’ that it wraps is a
future which implements the ‘Unpin’ trait.

That's a lot!  But we can understand it, if we dive a little further
into how the ‘Future’ type actually works, in particular around
‘pinning’.

Let's look again at the definition of ‘Future’:

use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    // Required method
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}

The ‘cx’ parameter and its ‘Context’ type is the key to how a runtime
actually knows when to check any given future, while still being lazy.
The details of how that works are beyond the scope of this chapter,
though: you generally only need to worry about it when writing a custom
‘Future’ implementation.

Instead, we'll focus on the type for ‘self’.  This is the first time
we've seen a method where ‘self’ has a type annotation.  A type
annotation for ‘self’ is similar to type annotations for other function
parameters, with two key differences.  First, when we specify the type
of ‘self’ in this way, we're telling Rust what type ‘self’ must be to
call this method.  Second, a type annotation on ‘self’ can't be just any
type.  It's only allowed to be the type on which the method is
implemented, a reference or smart pointer to that type, or a ‘Pin’
wrapping a reference to that type.  We'll see more on this syntax in
Chapter 18.  For now, it's enough to know that if we want to poll a
future (to check whether it is ‘Pending’ or ‘Ready(Output)’), we need a
mutable reference to the type, which is wrapped in a ‘Pin’.

‘Pin’ is a wrapper type.  In some ways, it's similar to the ‘Box’, ‘Rc’,
and other smart pointer types we saw in Chapter 15, which also wrap
other types.  Unlike those, however, ‘Pin’ only works with ‘pointer
types’ such as references (‘&’ and ‘&mut’) and smart pointers (‘Box’,
‘Rc’, and so on).  To be precise, ‘Pin’ works with types which implement
the ‘Deref’ or ‘DerefMut’ traits, which we covered in Chapter 15.  You
can think of this restriction as equivalent to only working with
pointers, though, because implementing ‘Deref’ or ‘DerefMut’ means your
type behaves similarly to a pointer type.  ‘Pin’ is also not a pointer
itself, and it doesn't have any behavior of its own the way ‘Rc’ and
‘Arc’ do with ref counting.  It's purely a tool the compiler can use to
uphold the relevant guarantees, by wrapping pointers in the type.

Recalling that ‘await’ is implemented in terms of calls to ‘poll’, this
starts to explain the error message we saw above--but that was in terms
of ‘Unpin’, not ‘Pin’.  So what exactly are ‘Pin’ and ‘Unpin’, how do
they relate, and why does ‘Future’ need ‘self’ to be in a ‘Pin’ type to
call ‘poll’?

In *note Our First Async Program: Our First Async Program, we described
how a series of await points in a future get compiled into a state
machine--and noted how the compiler helps make sure that state machine
follows all of Rust's normal rules around safety, including borrowing
and ownership.  To make that work, Rust looks at what data is needed
between each await point and the next await point or the end of the
async block.  It then creates a corresponding variant in the state
machine it creates.  Each variant gets the access it needs to the data
that will be used in that section of the source code, whether by taking
ownership of that data or by getting a mutable or immutable reference to
it.

So far so good: if we get anything wrong about the ownership or
references in a given async block, the borrow checker will tell us.
When we want to move around the future that corresponds to that
block--like moving it into a ‘Vec’ to pass to ‘join_all’, the way we did
back in the *note “Working With Any Number of Futures”: Working With Any
Number of Futures. section--things get trickier.

When we move a future--whether by pushing into a data structure to use
as an iterator with ‘join_all’, or returning them from a function--that
actually means moving the state machine Rust creates for us.  And unlike
most other types in Rust, the futures Rust creates for async blocks can
end up with references to themselves in the fields of any given variant,
as in Figure 17-4 (a simplified illustration to help you get a feel for
the idea, rather than digging into what are often fairly complicated
details).

By default, though, any object which has a reference to itself is unsafe
to move, because references always point to the actual memory address of
the thing they refer to.  If you move the data structure itself, those
internal references will be left pointing to the old location.  However,
that memory location is now invalid.  For one thing, its value will not
be updated when you make changes to the data structure.  For
another--and more importantly!--the computer is now free to reuse that
memory for other things!  You could end up reading completely unrelated
data later.

In principle, the Rust compiler could try to update every reference to
an object every time it gets moved.  That would potentially be a lot of
performance overhead, especially given there can be a whole web of
references that need updating.  On the other hand, if we could make sure
the data structure in question ‘doesn't move in memory’, we don't have
to update any references.  This is exactly what Rust's borrow checker
requires: you can't move an item which has any active references to it
using safe code.

‘Pin’ builds on that to give us the exact guarantee we need.  When we
‘pin’ a value by wrapping a pointer to that value in ‘Pin’, it can no
longer move.  Thus, if you have ‘Pin<Box<SomeType>>’, you actually pin
the ‘SomeType’ value, ‘not’ the ‘Box’ pointer.  Figure 17-6 illustrates
this:

In fact, the ‘Box’ pointer can still move around freely.  Remember: we
care about making sure the data ultimately being referenced stays in its
place.  If a pointer moves around, but the data it points to is in the
same place, as in Figure 17-7, there's no potential problem.  (How you
would do this with a ‘Pin’ wrapping a ‘Box’ is more than we'll get into
in this particular discussion, but it would make for a good exercise!
If you look at the docs for the types as well as the ‘std::pin’ module,
you might be able to work out how you would do that.)  The key is that
the self-referential type itself cannot move, because it is still
pinned.

However, most types are perfectly safe to move around, even if they
happen to be behind a ‘Pin’ pointer.  We only need to think about
pinning when items have internal references.  Primitive values such as
numbers and booleans don't have any internal references, so they're
obviously safe.  Neither do most types you normally work with in Rust.
A ‘Vec’, for example, doesn't have any internal references it needs to
keep up to date this way, so you can move it around without worrying.
If you have a ‘Pin<Vec<String>>’, you'd have to do everything via the
safe but restrictive APIs provided by ‘Pin’, even though a ‘Vec<String>’
is always safe to move if there are no other references to it.  We need
a way to tell the compiler that it's actually just fine to move items
around in cases such as these.  For that, we have ‘Unpin’.

‘Unpin’ is a marker trait, similar to the ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’ traits we
saw in Chapter 16.  Recall that marker traits have no functionality of
their own.  They exist only to tell the compiler that it's safe to use
the type which implements a given trait in a particular context.
‘Unpin’ informs the compiler that a given type does ‘not’ need to uphold
any particular guarantees about whether the value in question can be
moved.

Just as with ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’, the compiler implements ‘Unpin’
automatically for all types where it can prove it is safe.  The special
case, again similar to ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’, is the case where ‘Unpin’ is
‘not’ implemented for a type.  The notation for this is ‘impl !Unpin for
SomeType’, where ‘SomeType’ is the name of a type which ‘does’ need to
uphold those guarantees to be safe whenever a pointer to that type is
used in a ‘Pin’.

In other words, there are two things to keep in mind about the
relationship between ‘Pin’ and ‘Unpin’.  First, ‘Unpin’ is the “normal”
case, and ‘!Unpin’ is the special case.  Second, whether a type
implements ‘Unpin’ or ‘!Unpin’ ‘only’ matters when using a pinned
pointer to that type like ‘Pin<&mut SomeType>’.

To make that concrete, think about a ‘String’: it has a length and the
Unicode characters which make it up.  We can wrap a ‘String’ in ‘Pin’,
as seen in Figure 17-8.  However, ‘String’ automatically implements
‘Unpin’, the same as most other types in Rust.

As a result, we can do things which would be illegal if ‘String’
implemented ‘!Unpin’ instead, such as replace one string with another at
the exact same location in memory as in Figure 17-9.  This doesn't
violate the ‘Pin’ contract, because ‘String’ has no internal references
that make it unsafe to move around!  That is precisely why it implements
‘Unpin’ rather than ‘!Unpin’.

Now we know enough to understand the errors reported for that ‘join_all’
call from back in Listing 17-17.  We originally tried to move the
futures produced by async blocks into a ‘Vec<Box<dyn Future<Output =
()>>>’, but as we've seen, those futures may have internal references,
so they don't implement ‘Unpin’.  They need to be pinned, and then we
can pass the ‘Pin’ type into the ‘Vec’, confident that the underlying
data in the futures will ‘not’ be moved.

‘Pin’ and ‘Unpin’ are mostly important for building lower-level
libraries, or when you're building a runtime itself, rather than for day
to day Rust code.  When you see these traits in error messages, though,
now you'll have a better idea of how to fix the code!

Note: This combination of ‘Pin’ and ‘Unpin’ allows a whole class of
complex types to be safe in Rust which are otherwise difficult to
implement because they're self-referential.  Types which require ‘Pin’
show up ‘most’ commonly in async Rust today, but you might--very
rarely!--see it in other contexts, too.

The specifics of how ‘Pin’ and ‘Unpin’ work, and the rules they're
required to uphold, are covered extensively in the API documentation for
‘std::pin’, so if you'd like to understand them more deeply, that's a
great place to start.

If you want to understand how things work “under the hood” in even more
detail, the official ‘Asynchronous Programming in Rust’
(https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) book has you covered:

19.2.6.3 The Stream Trait
.........................

Now that we have a deeper grasp on the ‘Future’, ‘Pin’, and ‘Unpin’
traits, we can turn our attention to the ‘Stream’ trait.  As described
in the section introducing streams, streams are similar to asynchronous
iterators.  Unlike ‘Iterator’ and ‘Future’, there is no definition of a
‘Stream’ trait in the standard library as of the time of writing, but
there ‘is’ a very common definition from the ‘futures’ crate used
throughout the ecosystem.

Let's review the definitions of the ‘Iterator’ and ‘Future’ traits, so
we can build up to how a ‘Stream’ trait that merges them together might
look.  From ‘Iterator’, we have the idea of a sequence: its ‘next’
method provides an ‘Option<Self::Item>’.  From ‘Future’, we have the
idea of readiness over time: its ‘poll’ method provides a
‘Poll<Self::Output>’.  To represent a sequence of items which become
ready over time, we define a ‘Stream’ trait which puts those features
together:

use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

trait Stream {
    type Item;

    fn poll_next(
        self: Pin<&mut Self>,
        cx: &mut Context<'_>
    ) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>>;
}

The ‘Stream’ trait defines an associated type ‘Item’ for the type of the
items produced by the stream.  This is similar to ‘Iterator’: there may
be zero to many of these, and unlike ‘Future’, where there is always a
single ‘Output’ (even if it's the unit type ‘()’).

‘Stream’ also defines a method to get those items.  We call it
‘poll_next’, to make it clear that it polls in the same way
‘Future::poll’ does and produces a sequence of items in the same way
‘Iterator::next’ does.  Its return type combines ‘Poll’ with ‘Option’.
The outer type is ‘Poll’, because it has to be checked for readiness,
just as a future does.  The inner type is ‘Option’, because it needs to
signal whether there are more messages, just as an iterator does.

Something very similar to this will likely end up standardized as part
of Rust's standard library.  In the meantime, it's part of the toolkit
of most runtimes, so you can rely on it, and everything we cover below
should generally apply!

In the example we saw in the section on streaming, though, we didn't use
‘poll_next’ ‘or’ ‘Stream’, but instead used ‘next’ and ‘StreamExt’.  We
‘could’ work directly in terms of the ‘poll_next’ API by hand-writing
our own ‘Stream’ state machines, of course, just as we ‘could’ work with
futures directly via their ‘poll’ method.  Using ‘await’ is much nicer,
though, so the ‘StreamExt’ trait supplies the ‘next’ method so we can do
just that.

trait StreamExt: Stream {
    async fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>
    where
        Self: Unpin;

    // other methods...
}

Note: The actual definition we used earlier in the chapter looks
slightly different than this, because it supports versions of Rust which
did not yet support using async functions in traits.  As a result, it
looks like this:

fn next(&mut self) -> Next<'_, Self> where Self: Unpin;

That ‘Next’ type is a ‘struct’ which implements ‘Future’ and gives a way
to name the lifetime of the reference to ‘self’ with ‘Next<'_, Self>’,
so that ‘await’ can work with this method!

The ‘StreamExt’ trait is also the home of all the interesting methods
available to use with streams.  ‘StreamExt’ is automatically implemented
for every type which implements ‘Stream’, but these traits are defined
separately so that the community can iterate on the foundational trait
distinctly from the convenience APIs.

In the version of ‘StreamExt’ used in the ‘trpl’ crate, the trait not
only defines the ‘next’ method, it also supplies an implementation of
‘next’, which correctly handles the details of calling
‘Stream::poll_next’.  This means that even when you need to write your
own streaming data type, you ‘only’ have to implement ‘Stream’, and then
anyone who uses your data type can use ‘StreamExt’ and its methods with
it automatically.

That's all we're going to cover for the lower-level details on these
traits.  To wrap up, let's consider how futures (including streams),
tasks, and threads all fit together!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Futures Tasks and Threads,  Next: Summary 17,  Prev: Digging Into the Traits for Async,  Up: Async and Await

19.2.7 Futures, Tasks, and Threads
----------------------------------

As we saw in the previous chapter, threads provide one approach to
concurrency.  We've seen another approach to concurrency in this
chapter, using async with futures and streams.  You might be wondering
why you would choose one or the other.  The answer is: it depends!  And
in many cases, the choice isn't threads ‘or’ async but rather threads
‘and’ async.

Many operating systems have supplied threading-based concurrency models
for decades now, and many programming languages have support for them as
a result.  However, they are not without their tradeoffs.  On many
operating systems, they use a fair bit of memory for each thread, and
they come with some overhead for starting up and shutting down.  Threads
are also only an option when your operating system and hardware support
them!  Unlike mainstream desktop and mobile computers, some embedded
systems don't have an OS at all, so they also don't have threads!

The async model provides a different--and ultimately complementary--set
of tradeoffs.  In the async model, concurrent operations don't require
their own threads.  Instead, they can run on tasks, as when we used
‘trpl::spawn_task’ to kick off work from a synchronous function
throughout the streams section.  A task is similar to a thread, but
instead of being managed by the operating system, it's managed by
library-level code: the runtime.

In the previous section, we saw that we could build a ‘Stream’ by using
an async channel and spawning an async task which we could call from
synchronous code.  We could do the exact same thing with a thread!  In
Listing 17-40, we used ‘trpl::spawn_task’ and ‘trpl::sleep’.  In Listing
17-41, we replace those with the ‘thread::spawn’ and ‘thread::sleep’
APIs from the standard library in the ‘get_intervals’ function.

fn get_intervals() -> impl Stream<Item = u32> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    // This is *not* `trpl::spawn` but `std::thread::spawn`!
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut count = 0;
        loop {
            // Likewise, this is *not* `trpl::sleep` but `std::thread::sleep`!
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
            count += 1;

            if let Err(send_error) = tx.send(count) {
                eprintln!("Could not send interval {count}: {send_error}");
                break;
            };
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}

If you run this, the output is identical.  And notice how little changes
here from the perspective of the calling code!  What's more, even though
one of our functions spawned an async task on the runtime and the other
spawned an OS thread, the resulting streams were unaffected by the
differences.

Despite the similarities, these two approaches behave very differently,
although we might have a hard time measuring it in this very simple
example.  We could spawn millions of async tasks on any modern personal
computer.  If we tried to do that with threads, we would literally run
out of memory!

However, there's a reason these APIs are so similar.  Threads act as a
boundary for sets of synchronous operations; concurrency is possible
‘between’ threads.  Tasks act as a boundary for sets of ‘asynchronous’
operations; concurrency is possible both ‘between’ and ‘within’ tasks,
because a task can switch between futures in its body.  Finally, futures
are Rust's most granular unit of concurrency, and each future may
represent a tree of other futures.  The runtime--specifically, its
executor--manages tasks, and tasks manage futures.  In that regard,
tasks are similar to lightweight, runtime-managed threads with added
capabilities that come from being managed by a runtime instead of by the
operating system.

This doesn't mean that async tasks are always better than threads, any
more than that threads are always better than tasks.

Concurrency with threads is in some ways a simpler programming model
than concurrency with ‘async’.  That can be a strength or a weakness.
Threads are somewhat “fire and forget,” they have no native equivalent
to a future, so they simply run to completion, without interruption
except by the operating system itself.  That is, they have no built-in
support for ‘intra-task concurrency’ the way futures do.  Threads in
Rust also have no mechanisms for cancellation--a subject we haven't
covered in depth in this chapter, but which is implicit in the fact that
whenever we ended a future, its state got cleaned up correctly.

These limitations also make threads harder to compose than futures.
It's much more difficult, for example, to use threads to build helpers
such as the ‘timeout’ we built in *note “Building Our Own Async
Abstractions”: Building Our Own Async Abstractions. or the ‘throttle’
method we used with streams in *note “Composing Streams”: Composing
Streams.  The fact that futures are richer data structures means they
can be composed together more naturally, as we have seen.

Tasks then give ‘additional’ control over futures, allowing you to
choose where and how to group the futures.  And it turns out that
threads and tasks often work very well together, because tasks can (at
least in some runtimes) be moved around between threads.  We haven't
mentioned it up until now, but under the hood the ‘Runtime’ we have been
using, including the ‘spawn_blocking’ and ‘spawn_task’ functions, is
multithreaded by default!  Many runtimes use an approach called ‘work
stealing’ to transparently move tasks around between threads based on
the current utilization of the threads, with the aim of improving the
overall performance of the system.  To build that actually requires
threads ‘and’ tasks, and therefore futures.

As a default way of thinking about which to use when:

   • If the work is ‘very parallelizable’, such as processing a bunch of
     data where each part can be processed separately, threads are a
     better choice.
   • If the work is ‘very concurrent’, such as handling messages from a
     bunch of different sources which may come in a different intervals
     or different rates, async is a better choice.

And if you need some mix of parallelism and concurrency, you don't have
to choose between threads and async.  You can use them together freely,
letting each one serve the part it is best at.  For example, Listing
17-42 shows a fairly common example of this kind of mix in real-world
Rust code.

use std::{thread, time::Duration};

fn main() {
    let (tx, mut rx) = trpl::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..11 {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    trpl::run(async {
        while let Some(message) = rx.recv().await {
            println!("{message}");
        }
    });
}

We begin by creating an async channel.  Then we spawn a thread which
takes ownership of the sender side of the channel.  Within the thread,
we send the numbers 1 through 10, and sleep for a second in between
each.  Finally, we run a future created with an async block passed to
‘trpl::run’ just as we have throughout the chapter.  In that future, we
await those messages, just as in the other message-passing examples we
have seen.

To return to the examples we opened the chapter with: you could imagine
running a set of video encoding tasks using a dedicated thread, because
video encoding is compute bound, but notifying the UI that those
operations are done with an async channel.  Examples of this kind of mix
abound!

--------------

This isn't the last you'll see of concurrency in this book: the project
in Chapter 21 will use the concepts in this chapter in a more realistic
situation than the smaller examples discussed here--and compare more
directly what it looks like to solve these kinds of problems with
threading vs.  with tasks and futures.

Whether with threads, with futures and tasks, or with the combination of
them all, Rust gives you the tools you need to write safe, fast,
concurrent code--whether for a high-throughput web server or an embedded
operating system.

Next, we'll talk about idiomatic ways to model problems and structure
solutions as your Rust programs get bigger.  In addition, we'll discuss
how Rust's idioms relate to those you might be familiar with from
object-oriented programming.

20 Object-Oriented Programming Features of Rust
***********************************************

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of modeling programs.
Objects as a programmatic concept were introduced in the programming
language Simula in the 1960s.  Those objects influenced Alan Kay's
programming architecture in which objects pass messages to each other.
To describe this architecture, he coined the term ‘object-oriented
programming’ in 1967.  Many competing definitions describe what OOP is,
and by some of these definitions Rust is object-oriented, but by others
it is not.  In this chapter, we'll explore certain characteristics that
are commonly considered object-oriented and how those characteristics
translate to idiomatic Rust.  We'll then show you how to implement an
object-oriented design pattern in Rust and discuss the trade-offs of
doing so versus implementing a solution using some of Rust's strengths
instead.

20.1 Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages
=================================================

There is no consensus in the programming community about what features a
language must have to be considered object-oriented.  Rust is influenced
by many programming paradigms, including OOP; for example, we explored
the features that came from functional programming in Chapter 13.
Arguably, OOP languages share certain common characteristics, namely
objects, encapsulation, and inheritance.  Let's look at what each of
those characteristics means and whether Rust supports it.

20.1.1 Objects Contain Data and Behavior
----------------------------------------

The book ‘Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software’ by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John
Vlissides (Addison-Wesley Professional, 1994), colloquially referred to
as ‘The Gang of Four’ book, is a catalog of object-oriented design
patterns.  It defines OOP this way:

Object-oriented programs are made up of objects.  An ‘object’ packages
both data and the procedures that operate on that data.  The procedures
are typically called ‘methods’ or ‘operations’.

Using this definition, Rust is object-oriented: structs and enums have
data, and ‘impl’ blocks provide methods on structs and enums.  Even
though structs and enums with methods aren't ‘called’ objects, they
provide the same functionality, according to the Gang of Four's
definition of objects.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details,  Next: Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing,  Prev: Objects Contain Data and Behavior,  Up: Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages

20.1.1.1 Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details
........................................................

Another aspect commonly associated with OOP is the idea of
‘encapsulation’, which means that the implementation details of an
object aren't accessible to code using that object.  Therefore, the only
way to interact with an object is through its public API; code using the
object shouldn't be able to reach into the object's internals and change
data or behavior directly.  This enables the programmer to change and
refactor an object's internals without needing to change the code that
uses the object.

We discussed how to control encapsulation in Chapter 7: we can use the
‘pub’ keyword to decide which modules, types, functions, and methods in
our code should be public, and by default everything else is private.
For example, we can define a struct ‘AveragedCollection’ that has a
field containing a vector of ‘i32’ values.  The struct can also have a
field that contains the average of the values in the vector, meaning the
average doesn't have to be computed on demand whenever anyone needs it.
In other words, ‘AveragedCollection’ will cache the calculated average
for us.  Listing 18-1 has the definition of the ‘AveragedCollection’
struct:

pub struct AveragedCollection {
    list: Vec<i32>,
    average: f64,
}

The struct is marked ‘pub’ so that other code can use it, but the fields
within the struct remain private.  This is important in this case
because we want to ensure that whenever a value is added or removed from
the list, the average is also updated.  We do this by implementing
‘add’, ‘remove’, and ‘average’ methods on the struct, as shown in
Listing 18-2:

impl AveragedCollection {
    pub fn add(&mut self, value: i32) {
        self.list.push(value);
        self.update_average();
    }

    pub fn remove(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
        let result = self.list.pop();
        match result {
            Some(value) => {
                self.update_average();
                Some(value)
            }
            None => None,
        }
    }

    pub fn average(&self) -> f64 {
        self.average
    }

    fn update_average(&mut self) {
        let total: i32 = self.list.iter().sum();
        self.average = total as f64 / self.list.len() as f64;
    }
}

The public methods ‘add’, ‘remove’, and ‘average’ are the only ways to
access or modify data in an instance of ‘AveragedCollection’.  When an
item is added to ‘list’ using the ‘add’ method or removed using the
‘remove’ method, the implementations of each call the private
‘update_average’ method that handles updating the ‘average’ field as
well.

We leave the ‘list’ and ‘average’ fields private so there is no way for
external code to add or remove items to or from the ‘list’ field
directly; otherwise, the ‘average’ field might become out of sync when
the ‘list’ changes.  The ‘average’ method returns the value in the
‘average’ field, allowing external code to read the ‘average’ but not
modify it.

Because we've encapsulated the implementation details of the struct
‘AveragedCollection’, we can easily change aspects, such as the data
structure, in the future.  For instance, we could use a ‘HashSet<i32>’
instead of a ‘Vec<i32>’ for the ‘list’ field.  As long as the signatures
of the ‘add’, ‘remove’, and ‘average’ public methods stay the same, code
using ‘AveragedCollection’ wouldn't need to change in order to compile.
If we made ‘list’ public instead, this wouldn't necessarily be the case:
‘HashSet<i32>’ and ‘Vec<i32>’ have different methods for adding and
removing items, so the external code would likely have to change if it
were modifying ‘list’ directly.

If encapsulation is a required aspect for a language to be considered
object-oriented, then Rust meets that requirement.  The option to use
‘pub’ or not for different parts of code enables encapsulation of
implementation details.

20.1.1.2 Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing
.........................................................

‘Inheritance’ is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from
another object's definition, thus gaining the parent object's data and
behavior without you having to define them again.

If a language must have inheritance to be an object-oriented language,
then Rust is not one.  There is no way to define a struct that inherits
the parent struct's fields and method implementations without using a
macro.

However, if you're used to having inheritance in your programming
toolbox, you can use other solutions in Rust, depending on your reason
for reaching for inheritance in the first place.

You would choose inheritance for two main reasons.  One is for reuse of
code: you can implement particular behavior for one type, and
inheritance enables you to reuse that implementation for a different
type.  You can do this in a limited way in Rust code using default trait
method implementations, which you saw in Listing 10-14 when we added a
default implementation of the ‘summarize’ method on the ‘Summary’ trait.
Any type implementing the ‘Summary’ trait would have the ‘summarize’
method available on it without any further code.  This is similar to a
parent class having an implementation of a method and an inheriting
child class also having the implementation of the method.  We can also
override the default implementation of the ‘summarize’ method when we
implement the ‘Summary’ trait, which is similar to a child class
overriding the implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.

The other reason to use inheritance relates to the type system: to
enable a child type to be used in the same places as the parent type.
This is also called ‘polymorphism’, which means that you can substitute
multiple objects for each other at runtime if they share certain
characteristics.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Polymorphism,  Next: Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types,  Prev: Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing,  Up: Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages

20.1.1.3 Polymorphism
.....................

To many people, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance.  But it's
actually a more general concept that refers to code that can work with
data of multiple types.  For inheritance, those types are generally
subclasses.

Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and
trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide.
This is sometimes called ‘bounded parametric polymorphism’.

Inheritance has recently fallen out of favor as a programming design
solution in many programming languages because it's often at risk of
sharing more code than necessary.  Subclasses shouldn't always share all
characteristics of their parent class but will do so with inheritance.
This can make a program's design less flexible.  It also introduces the
possibility of calling methods on subclasses that don't make sense or
that cause errors because the methods don't apply to the subclass.  In
addition, some languages will only allow single inheritance (meaning a
subclass can only inherit from one class), further restricting the
flexibility of a program's design.

For these reasons, Rust takes the different approach of using trait
objects instead of inheritance.  Let's look at how trait objects enable
polymorphism in Rust.

20.1.2 Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In Chapter 8, we mentioned that one limitation of vectors is that they
can store elements of only one type.  We created a workaround in Listing
8-9 where we defined a ‘SpreadsheetCell’ enum that had variants to hold
integers, floats, and text.  This meant we could store different types
of data in each cell and still have a vector that represented a row of
cells.  This is a perfectly good solution when our interchangeable items
are a fixed set of types that we know when our code is compiled.

However, sometimes we want our library user to be able to extend the set
of types that are valid in a particular situation.  To show how we might
achieve this, we'll create an example graphical user interface (GUI)
tool that iterates through a list of items, calling a ‘draw’ method on
each one to draw it to the screen--a common technique for GUI tools.
We'll create a library crate called ‘gui’ that contains the structure of
a GUI library.  This crate might include some types for people to use,
such as ‘Button’ or ‘TextField’.  In addition, ‘gui’ users will want to
create their own types that can be drawn: for instance, one programmer
might add an ‘Image’ and another might add a ‘SelectBox’.

We won't implement a fully fledged GUI library for this example but will
show how the pieces would fit together.  At the time of writing the
library, we can't know and define all the types other programmers might
want to create.  But we do know that ‘gui’ needs to keep track of many
values of different types, and it needs to call a ‘draw’ method on each
of these differently typed values.  It doesn't need to know exactly what
will happen when we call the ‘draw’ method, just that the value will
have that method available for us to call.

To do this in a language with inheritance, we might define a class named
‘Component’ that has a method named ‘draw’ on it.  The other classes,
such as ‘Button’, ‘Image’, and ‘SelectBox’, would inherit from
‘Component’ and thus inherit the ‘draw’ method.  They could each
override the ‘draw’ method to define their custom behavior, but the
framework could treat all of the types as if they were ‘Component’
instances and call ‘draw’ on them.  But because Rust doesn't have
inheritance, we need another way to structure the ‘gui’ library to allow
users to extend it with new types.

20.1.2.1 Defining a Trait for Common Behavior
.............................................

To implement the behavior we want ‘gui’ to have, we'll define a trait
named ‘Draw’ that will have one method named ‘draw’.  Then we can define
a vector that takes a ‘trait object’.  A trait object points to both an
instance of a type implementing our specified trait and a table used to
look up trait methods on that type at runtime.  We create a trait object
by specifying some sort of pointer, such as a ‘&’ reference or a
‘Box<T>’ smart pointer, then the ‘dyn’ keyword, and then specifying the
relevant trait.  (We'll talk about the reason trait objects must use a
pointer in Chapter 20 in the section *note “Dynamically Sized Types and
the ‘Sized’ Trait”: Dynamically Sized Types and the Sized Trait.) We can
use trait objects in place of a generic or concrete type.  Wherever we
use a trait object, Rust's type system will ensure at compile time that
any value used in that context will implement the trait object's trait.
Consequently, we don't need to know all the possible types at compile
time.

We've mentioned that, in Rust, we refrain from calling structs and enums
“objects” to distinguish them from other languages' objects.  In a
struct or enum, the data in the struct fields and the behavior in ‘impl’
blocks are separated, whereas in other languages, the data and behavior
combined into one concept is often labeled an object.  However, trait
objects ‘are’ more like objects in other languages in the sense that
they combine data and behavior.  But trait objects differ from
traditional objects in that we can't add data to a trait object.  Trait
objects aren't as generally useful as objects in other languages: their
specific purpose is to allow abstraction across common behavior.

Listing 18-3 shows how to define a trait named ‘Draw’ with one method
named ‘draw’:

pub trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}

This syntax should look familiar from our discussions on how to define
traits in Chapter 10.  Next comes some new syntax: Listing 18-4 defines
a struct named ‘Screen’ that holds a vector named ‘components’.  This
vector is of type ‘Box<dyn Draw>’, which is a trait object; it's a
stand-in for any type inside a ‘Box’ that implements the ‘Draw’ trait.

pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}

On the ‘Screen’ struct, we'll define a method named ‘run’ that will call
the ‘draw’ method on each of its ‘components’, as shown in Listing 18-5:

impl Screen {
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}

This works differently from defining a struct that uses a generic type
parameter with trait bounds.  A generic type parameter can only be
substituted with one concrete type at a time, whereas trait objects
allow for multiple concrete types to fill in for the trait object at
runtime.  For example, we could have defined the ‘Screen’ struct using a
generic type and a trait bound as in Listing 18-6:

pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
    pub components: Vec<T>,
}

impl<T> Screen<T>
where
    T: Draw,
{
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}

This restricts us to a ‘Screen’ instance that has a list of components
all of type ‘Button’ or all of type ‘TextField’.  If you'll only ever
have homogeneous collections, using generics and trait bounds is
preferable because the definitions will be monomorphized at compile time
to use the concrete types.

On the other hand, with the method using trait objects, one ‘Screen’
instance can hold a ‘Vec<T>’ that contains a ‘Box<Button>’ as well as a
‘Box<TextField>’.  Let's look at how this works, and then we'll talk
about the runtime performance implications.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Implementing the Trait,  Next: Trait Objects Perform Dynamic Dispatch,  Prev: Defining a Trait for Common Behavior,  Up: Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types

20.1.2.2 Implementing the Trait
...............................

Now we'll add some types that implement the ‘Draw’ trait.  We'll provide
the ‘Button’ type.  Again, actually implementing a GUI library is beyond
the scope of this book, so the ‘draw’ method won't have any useful
implementation in its body.  To imagine what the implementation might
look like, a ‘Button’ struct might have fields for ‘width’, ‘height’,
and ‘label’, as shown in Listing 18-7:

pub struct Button {
    pub width: u32,
    pub height: u32,
    pub label: String,
}

impl Draw for Button {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to actually draw a button
    }
}

The ‘width’, ‘height’, and ‘label’ fields on ‘Button’ will differ from
the fields on other components; for example, a ‘TextField’ type might
have those same fields plus a ‘placeholder’ field.  Each of the types we
want to draw on the screen will implement the ‘Draw’ trait but will use
different code in the ‘draw’ method to define how to draw that
particular type, as ‘Button’ has here (without the actual GUI code, as
mentioned).  The ‘Button’ type, for instance, might have an additional
‘impl’ block containing methods related to what happens when a user
clicks the button.  These kinds of methods won't apply to types like
‘TextField’.

If someone using our library decides to implement a ‘SelectBox’ struct
that has ‘width’, ‘height’, and ‘options’ fields, they implement the
‘Draw’ trait on the ‘SelectBox’ type as well, as shown in Listing 18-8:

use gui::Draw;

struct SelectBox {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
    options: Vec<String>,
}

impl Draw for SelectBox {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to actually draw a select box
    }
}

Our library's user can now write their ‘main’ function to create a
‘Screen’ instance.  To the ‘Screen’ instance, they can add a ‘SelectBox’
and a ‘Button’ by putting each in a ‘Box<T>’ to become a trait object.
They can then call the ‘run’ method on the ‘Screen’ instance, which will
call ‘draw’ on each of the components.  Listing 18-9 shows this
implementation:

use gui::{Button, Screen};

fn main() {
    let screen = Screen {
        components: vec![
            Box::new(SelectBox {
                width: 75,
                height: 10,
                options: vec![
                    String::from("Yes"),
                    String::from("Maybe"),
                    String::from("No"),
                ],
            }),
            Box::new(Button {
                width: 50,
                height: 10,
                label: String::from("OK"),
            }),
        ],
    };

    screen.run();
}

When we wrote the library, we didn't know that someone might add the
‘SelectBox’ type, but our ‘Screen’ implementation was able to operate on
the new type and draw it because ‘SelectBox’ implements the ‘Draw’
trait, which means it implements the ‘draw’ method.

This concept--of being concerned only with the messages a value responds
to rather than the value's concrete type--is similar to the concept of
‘duck typing’ in dynamically typed languages: if it walks like a duck
and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck!  In the implementation
of ‘run’ on ‘Screen’ in Listing 18-5, ‘run’ doesn't need to know what
the concrete type of each component is.  It doesn't check whether a
component is an instance of a ‘Button’ or a ‘SelectBox’, it just calls
the ‘draw’ method on the component.  By specifying ‘Box<dyn Draw>’ as
the type of the values in the ‘components’ vector, we've defined
‘Screen’ to need values that we can call the ‘draw’ method on.

The advantage of using trait objects and Rust's type system to write
code similar to code using duck typing is that we never have to check
whether a value implements a particular method at runtime or worry about
getting errors if a value doesn't implement a method but we call it
anyway.  Rust won't compile our code if the values don't implement the
traits that the trait objects need.

For example, Listing 18-10 shows what happens if we try to create a
‘Screen’ with a ‘String’ as a component:

use gui::Screen;

fn main() {
    let screen = Screen {
        components: vec![Box::new(String::from("Hi"))],
    };

    screen.run();
}

We'll get this error because ‘String’ doesn't implement the ‘Draw’
trait:

$ cargo run
   Compiling gui v0.1.0 (file:///projects/gui)
error[E0277]: the trait bound `String: Draw` is not satisfied
 --> src/main.rs:5:26
  |

  = note: required for the cast from `Box<String>` to `Box<dyn Draw>`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.

This error lets us know that either we're passing something to ‘Screen’
we didn't mean to pass and so should pass a different type or we should
implement ‘Draw’ on ‘String’ so that ‘Screen’ is able to call ‘draw’ on
it.

20.1.2.3 Trait Objects Perform Dynamic Dispatch
...............................................

Recall in the *note “Performance of Code Using Generics”: Performance of
Code Using Generics. section in Chapter 10 our discussion on the
monomorphization process performed by the compiler when we use trait
bounds on generics: the compiler generates nongeneric implementations of
functions and methods for each concrete type that we use in place of a
generic type parameter.  The code that results from monomorphization is
doing ‘static dispatch’, which is when the compiler knows what method
you're calling at compile time.  This is opposed to ‘dynamic dispatch’,
which is when the compiler can't tell at compile time which method
you're calling.  In dynamic dispatch cases, the compiler emits code that
at runtime will figure out which method to call.

When we use trait objects, Rust must use dynamic dispatch.  The compiler
doesn't know all the types that might be used with the code that's using
trait objects, so it doesn't know which method implemented on which type
to call.  Instead, at runtime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait
object to know which method to call.  This lookup incurs a runtime cost
that doesn't occur with static dispatch.  Dynamic dispatch also prevents
the compiler from choosing to inline a method's code, which in turn
prevents some optimizations, and Rust has some rules about where you can
and cannot use dynamic dispatch, called ‘dyn compatibility’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#dyn-compatibility).
However, we did get extra flexibility in the code that we wrote in
Listing 18-5 and were able to support in Listing 18-9, so it's a
trade-off to consider.

20.1.3 Implementing an Object-Oriented Design Pattern
-----------------------------------------------------

The ‘state pattern’ is an object-oriented design pattern.  The crux of
the pattern is that we define a set of states a value can have
internally.  The states are represented by a set of ‘state objects’, and
the value's behavior changes based on its state.  We're going to work
through an example of a blog post struct that has a field to hold its
state, which will be a state object from the set "draft", "review", or
"published".

The state objects share functionality: in Rust, of course, we use
structs and traits rather than objects and inheritance.  Each state
object is responsible for its own behavior and for governing when it
should change into another state.  The value that holds a state object
knows nothing about the different behavior of the states or when to
transition between states.

The advantage of using the state pattern is that, when the business
requirements of the program change, we won't need to change the code of
the value holding the state or the code that uses the value.  We'll only
need to update the code inside one of the state objects to change its
rules or perhaps add more state objects.

First, we're going to implement the state pattern in a more traditional
object-oriented way, then we'll use an approach that's a bit more
natural in Rust.  Let's dig in to incrementally implementing a blog post
workflow using the state pattern.

The final functionality will look like this:

  1. A blog post starts as an empty draft.
  2. When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.
  3. When the post is approved, it gets published.
  4. Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved
     posts can't accidentally be published.

Any other changes attempted on a post should have no effect.  For
example, if we try to approve a draft blog post before we've requested a
review, the post should remain an unpublished draft.

Listing 18-11 shows this workflow in code form: this is an example usage
of the API we'll implement in a library crate named ‘blog’.  This won't
compile yet because we haven't implemented the ‘blog’ crate.

use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text("I ate a salad for lunch today");
    assert_eq!("", post.content());

    post.request_review();
    assert_eq!("", post.content());

    post.approve();
    assert_eq!("I ate a salad for lunch today", post.content());
}

We want to allow the user to create a new draft blog post with
‘Post::new’.  We want to allow text to be added to the blog post.  If we
try to get the post's content immediately, before approval, we shouldn't
get any text because the post is still a draft.  We've added
‘assert_eq!’ in the code for demonstration purposes.  An excellent unit
test for this would be to assert that a draft blog post returns an empty
string from the ‘content’ method, but we're not going to write tests for
this example.

Next, we want to enable a request for a review of the post, and we want
‘content’ to return an empty string while waiting for the review.  When
the post receives approval, it should get published, meaning the text of
the post will be returned when ‘content’ is called.

Notice that the only type we're interacting with from the crate is the
‘Post’ type.  This type will use the state pattern and will hold a value
that will be one of three state objects representing the various states
a post can be in--draft, waiting for review, or published.  Changing
from one state to another will be managed internally within the ‘Post’
type.  The states change in response to the methods called by our
library's users on the ‘Post’ instance, but they don't have to manage
the state changes directly.  Also, users can't make a mistake with the
states, like publishing a post before it's reviewed.

20.1.3.1 Defining ‘Post’ and Creating a New Instance in the
...........................................................

Draft State Let's get started on the implementation of the library!  We
know we need a public ‘Post’ struct that holds some content, so we'll
start with the definition of the struct and an associated public ‘new’
function to create an instance of ‘Post’, as shown in Listing 18-12.
We'll also make a private ‘State’ trait that will define the behavior
that all state objects for a ‘Post’ must have.

Then ‘Post’ will hold a trait object of ‘Box<dyn State>’ inside an
‘Option<T>’ in a private field named ‘state’ to hold the state object.
You'll see why the ‘Option<T>’ is necessary in a bit.

pub struct Post {
    state: Option<Box<dyn State>>,
    content: String,
}

impl Post {
    pub fn new() -> Post {
        Post {
            state: Some(Box::new(Draft {})),
            content: String::new(),
        }
    }
}

trait State {}

struct Draft {}

impl State for Draft {}

The ‘State’ trait defines the behavior shared by different post states.
The state objects are ‘Draft’, ‘PendingReview’, and ‘Published’, and
they will all implement the ‘State’ trait.  For now, the trait doesn't
have any methods, and we'll start by defining just the ‘Draft’ state
because that is the state we want a post to start in.

When we create a new ‘Post’, we set its ‘state’ field to a ‘Some’ value
that holds a ‘Box’.  This ‘Box’ points to a new instance of the ‘Draft’
struct.  This ensures whenever we create a new instance of ‘Post’, it
will start out as a draft.  Because the ‘state’ field of ‘Post’ is
private, there is no way to create a ‘Post’ in any other state!  In the
‘Post::new’ function, we set the ‘content’ field to a new, empty
‘String’.

20.1.3.2 Storing the Text of the Post Content
.............................................

We saw in Listing 18-11 that we want to be able to call a method named
‘add_text’ and pass it a ‘&str’ that is then added as the text content
of the blog post.  We implement this as a method, rather than exposing
the ‘content’ field as ‘pub’, so that later we can implement a method
that will control how the ‘content’ field's data is read.  The
‘add_text’ method is pretty straightforward, so let's add the
implementation in Listing 18-13 to the ‘impl Post’ block:

impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {
        self.content.push_str(text);
    }
}

The ‘add_text’ method takes a mutable reference to ‘self’, because we're
changing the ‘Post’ instance that we're calling ‘add_text’ on.  We then
call ‘push_str’ on the ‘String’ in ‘content’ and pass the ‘text’
argument to add to the saved ‘content’.  This behavior doesn't depend on
the state the post is in, so it's not part of the state pattern.  The
‘add_text’ method doesn't interact with the ‘state’ field at all, but it
is part of the behavior we want to support.

20.1.3.3 Ensuring the Content of a Draft Post Is Empty
......................................................

Even after we've called ‘add_text’ and added some content to our post,
we still want the ‘content’ method to return an empty string slice
because the post is still in the draft state, as shown on line 7 of
Listing 18-11.  For now, let's implement the ‘content’ method with the
simplest thing that will fulfill this requirement: always returning an
empty string slice.  We'll change this later once we implement the
ability to change a post's state so it can be published.  So far, posts
can only be in the draft state, so the post content should always be
empty.  Listing 18-14 shows this placeholder implementation:

impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
        ""
    }
}

With this added ‘content’ method, everything in Listing 18-11 up to line
7 works as intended.

20.1.3.4 Requesting a Review of the Post Changes Its State
..........................................................

Next, we need to add functionality to request a review of a post, which
should change its state from ‘Draft’ to ‘PendingReview’.  Listing 18-15
shows this code:

impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn request_review(&mut self) {
        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {
            self.state = Some(s.request_review())
        }
    }
}

trait State {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
}

struct Draft {}

impl State for Draft {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        Box::new(PendingReview {})
    }
}

struct PendingReview {}

impl State for PendingReview {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }
}

We give ‘Post’ a public method named ‘request_review’ that will take a
mutable reference to ‘self’.  Then we call an internal ‘request_review’
method on the current state of ‘Post’, and this second ‘request_review’
method consumes the current state and returns a new state.

We add the ‘request_review’ method to the ‘State’ trait; all types that
implement the trait will now need to implement the ‘request_review’
method.  Note that rather than having ‘self’, ‘&self’, or ‘&mut self’ as
the first parameter of the method, we have ‘self: Box<Self>’.  This
syntax means the method is only valid when called on a ‘Box’ holding the
type.  This syntax takes ownership of ‘Box<Self>’, invalidating the old
state so the state value of the ‘Post’ can transform into a new state.

To consume the old state, the ‘request_review’ method needs to take
ownership of the state value.  This is where the ‘Option’ in the ‘state’
field of ‘Post’ comes in: we call the ‘take’ method to take the ‘Some’
value out of the ‘state’ field and leave a ‘None’ in its place, because
Rust doesn't let us have unpopulated fields in structs.  This lets us
move the ‘state’ value out of ‘Post’ rather than borrowing it.  Then
we'll set the post's ‘state’ value to the result of this operation.

We need to set ‘state’ to ‘None’ temporarily rather than setting it
directly with code like ‘self.state = self.state.request_review();’ to
get ownership of the ‘state’ value.  This ensures ‘Post’ can't use the
old ‘state’ value after we've transformed it into a new state.

The ‘request_review’ method on ‘Draft’ returns a new, boxed instance of
a new ‘PendingReview’ struct, which represents the state when a post is
waiting for a review.  The ‘PendingReview’ struct also implements the
‘request_review’ method but doesn't do any transformations.  Rather, it
returns itself, because when we request a review on a post already in
the ‘PendingReview’ state, it should stay in the ‘PendingReview’ state.

Now we can start seeing the advantages of the state pattern: the
‘request_review’ method on ‘Post’ is the same no matter its ‘state’
value.  Each state is responsible for its own rules.

We'll leave the ‘content’ method on ‘Post’ as is, returning an empty
string slice.  We can now have a ‘Post’ in the ‘PendingReview’ state as
well as in the ‘Draft’ state, but we want the same behavior in the
‘PendingReview’ state.  Listing 18-11 now works up to line 10!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Adding approve to Change the Behavior of content,  Next: Trade-offs of the State Pattern,  Prev: Requesting a Review of the Post Changes Its State,  Up: Implementing an Object-Oriented Design Pattern

20.1.3.5 Adding ‘approve’ to Change the Behavior of
...................................................

‘content’ The ‘approve’ method will be similar to the ‘request_review’
method: it will set ‘state’ to the value that the current state says it
should have when that state is approved, as shown in Listing 18-16:

impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn approve(&mut self) {
        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {
            self.state = Some(s.approve())
        }
    }
}

trait State {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
}

struct Draft {}

impl State for Draft {
    // --snip--
    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }
}

struct PendingReview {}

impl State for PendingReview {
    // --snip--
    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        Box::new(Published {})
    }
}

struct Published {}

impl State for Published {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }

    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }
}

We add the ‘approve’ method to the ‘State’ trait and add a new struct
that implements ‘State’, the ‘Published’ state.

Similar to the way ‘request_review’ on ‘PendingReview’ works, if we call
the ‘approve’ method on a ‘Draft’, it will have no effect because
‘approve’ will return ‘self’.  When we call ‘approve’ on
‘PendingReview’, it returns a new, boxed instance of the ‘Published’
struct.  The ‘Published’ struct implements the ‘State’ trait, and for
both the ‘request_review’ method and the ‘approve’ method, it returns
itself, because the post should stay in the ‘Published’ state in those
cases.

Now we need to update the ‘content’ method on ‘Post’.  We want the value
returned from ‘content’ to depend on the current state of the ‘Post’, so
we're going to have the ‘Post’ delegate to a ‘content’ method defined on
its ‘state’, as shown in Listing 18-17:

impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
        self.state.as_ref().unwrap().content(self)
    }
    // --snip--
}

Because the goal is to keep all these rules inside the structs that
implement ‘State’, we call a ‘content’ method on the value in ‘state’
and pass the post instance (that is, ‘self’) as an argument.  Then we
return the value that's returned from using the ‘content’ method on the
‘state’ value.

We call the ‘as_ref’ method on the ‘Option’ because we want a reference
to the value inside the ‘Option’ rather than ownership of the value.
Because ‘state’ is an ‘Option<Box<dyn State>>’, when we call ‘as_ref’,
an ‘Option<&Box<dyn State>>’ is returned.  If we didn't call ‘as_ref’,
we would get an error because we can't move ‘state’ out of the borrowed
‘&self’ of the function parameter.

We then call the ‘unwrap’ method, which we know will never panic,
because we know the methods on ‘Post’ ensure that ‘state’ will always
contain a ‘Some’ value when those methods are done.  This is one of the
cases we talked about in the *note “Cases In Which You Have More
Information Than the Compiler”: Cases in Which You Have More Information
Than the Compiler. section of Chapter 9 when we know that a ‘None’ value
is never possible, even though the compiler isn't able to understand
that.

At this point, when we call ‘content’ on the ‘&Box<dyn State>’, deref
coercion will take effect on the ‘&’ and the ‘Box’ so the ‘content’
method will ultimately be called on the type that implements the ‘State’
trait.  That means we need to add ‘content’ to the ‘State’ trait
definition, and that is where we'll put the logic for what content to
return depending on which state we have, as shown in Listing 18-18:

trait State {
    // --snip--
    fn content<'a>(&self, post: &'a Post) -> &'a str {
        ""
    }
}

// --snip--
struct Published {}

impl State for Published {
    // --snip--
    fn content<'a>(&self, post: &'a Post) -> &'a str {
        &post.content
    }
}

We add a default implementation for the ‘content’ method that returns an
empty string slice.  That means we don't need to implement ‘content’ on
the ‘Draft’ and ‘PendingReview’ structs.  The ‘Published’ struct will
override the ‘content’ method and return the value in ‘post.content’.

Note that we need lifetime annotations on this method, as we discussed
in Chapter 10.  We're taking a reference to a ‘post’ as an argument and
returning a reference to part of that ‘post’, so the lifetime of the
returned reference is related to the lifetime of the ‘post’ argument.

And we're done--all of Listing 18-11 now works!  We've implemented the
state pattern with the rules of the blog post workflow.  The logic
related to the rules lives in the state objects rather than being
scattered throughout ‘Post’.

Why Not An Enum?  You may have been wondering why we didn't use an
‘enum’ with the different possible post states as variants.  That's
certainly a possible solution, try it and compare the end results to see
which you prefer!  One disadvantage of using an enum is every place that
checks the value of the enum will need a ‘match’ expression or similar
to handle every possible variant.  This could get more repetitive than
this trait object solution.

20.1.3.6 Trade-offs of the State Pattern
........................................

We've shown that Rust is capable of implementing the object-oriented
state pattern to encapsulate the different kinds of behavior a post
should have in each state.  The methods on ‘Post’ know nothing about the
various behaviors.  The way we organized the code, we have to look in
only one place to know the different ways a published post can behave:
the implementation of the ‘State’ trait on the ‘Published’ struct.

If we were to create an alternative implementation that didn't use the
state pattern, we might instead use ‘match’ expressions in the methods
on ‘Post’ or even in the ‘main’ code that checks the state of the post
and changes behavior in those places.  That would mean we would have to
look in several places to understand all the implications of a post
being in the published state!  This would only increase the more states
we added: each of those ‘match’ expressions would need another arm.

With the state pattern, the ‘Post’ methods and the places we use ‘Post’
don't need ‘match’ expressions, and to add a new state, we would only
need to add a new struct and implement the trait methods on that one
struct.

The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more
functionality.  To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the
state pattern, try a few of these suggestions:

   • Add a ‘reject’ method that changes the post's state from
     ‘PendingReview’ back to ‘Draft’.
   • Require two calls to ‘approve’ before the state can be changed to
     ‘Published’.
   • Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the ‘Draft’
     state.  Hint: have the state object responsible for what might
     change about the content but not responsible for modifying the
     ‘Post’.

One downside of the state pattern is that, because the states implement
the transitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each
other.  If we add another state between ‘PendingReview’ and ‘Published’,
such as ‘Scheduled’, we would have to change the code in ‘PendingReview’
to transition to ‘Scheduled’ instead.  It would be less work if
‘PendingReview’ didn't need to change with the addition of a new state,
but that would mean switching to another design pattern.

Another downside is that we've duplicated some logic.  To eliminate some
of the duplication, we might try to make default implementations for the
‘request_review’ and ‘approve’ methods on the ‘State’ trait that return
‘self’; however, this would not be dyn compatible, because the trait
doesn't know what the concrete ‘self’ will be exactly.  We want to be
able to use ‘State’ as a trait object, so we need its methods to be dyn
compatible.

Other duplication includes the similar implementations of the
‘request_review’ and ‘approve’ methods on ‘Post’.  Both methods delegate
to the implementation of the same method on the value in the ‘state’
field of ‘Option’ and set the new value of the ‘state’ field to the
result.  If we had a lot of methods on ‘Post’ that followed this
pattern, we might consider defining a macro to eliminate the repetition
(see the *note “Macros”: Macros. section in Chapter 20).

By implementing the state pattern exactly as it's defined for
object-oriented languages, we're not taking as full advantage of Rust's
strengths as we could.  Let's look at some changes we can make to the
‘blog’ crate that can make invalid states and transitions into compile
time errors.  Encoding States and Behavior as Types We'll show you how
to rethink the state pattern to get a different set of trade-offs.
Rather than encapsulating the states and transitions completely so
outside code has no knowledge of them, we'll encode the states into
different types.  Consequently, Rust's type checking system will prevent
attempts to use draft posts where only published posts are allowed by
issuing a compiler error.

Let's consider the first part of ‘main’ in Listing 18-11:

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text("I ate a salad for lunch today");
    assert_eq!("", post.content());
}

We still enable the creation of new posts in the draft state using
‘Post::new’ and the ability to add text to the post's content.  But
instead of having a ‘content’ method on a draft post that returns an
empty string, we'll make it so draft posts don't have the ‘content’
method at all.  That way, if we try to get a draft post's content, we'll
get a compiler error telling us the method doesn't exist.  As a result,
it will be impossible for us to accidentally display draft post content
in production, because that code won't even compile.  Listing 18-19
shows the definition of a ‘Post’ struct and a ‘DraftPost’ struct, as
well as methods on each:

pub struct Post {
    content: String,
}

pub struct DraftPost {
    content: String,
}

impl Post {
    pub fn new() -> DraftPost {
        DraftPost {
            content: String::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
        &self.content
    }
}

impl DraftPost {
    pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {
        self.content.push_str(text);
    }
}

Both the ‘Post’ and ‘DraftPost’ structs have a private ‘content’ field
that stores the blog post text.  The structs no longer have the ‘state’
field because we're moving the encoding of the state to the types of the
structs.  The ‘Post’ struct will represent a published post, and it has
a ‘content’ method that returns the ‘content’.

We still have a ‘Post::new’ function, but instead of returning an
instance of ‘Post’, it returns an instance of ‘DraftPost’.  Because
‘content’ is private and there aren't any functions that return ‘Post’,
it's not possible to create an instance of ‘Post’ right now.

The ‘DraftPost’ struct has an ‘add_text’ method, so we can add text to
‘content’ as before, but note that ‘DraftPost’ does not have a ‘content’
method defined!  So now the program ensures all posts start as draft
posts, and draft posts don't have their content available for display.
Any attempt to get around these constraints will result in a compiler
error.  Implementing Transitions as Transformations into Different Types
So how do we get a published post?  We want to enforce the rule that a
draft post has to be reviewed and approved before it can be published.
A post in the pending review state should still not display any content.
Let's implement these constraints by adding another struct,
‘PendingReviewPost’, defining the ‘request_review’ method on ‘DraftPost’
to return a ‘PendingReviewPost’, and defining an ‘approve’ method on
‘PendingReviewPost’ to return a ‘Post’, as shown in Listing 18-20:

impl DraftPost {
    // --snip--
    pub fn request_review(self) -> PendingReviewPost {
        PendingReviewPost {
            content: self.content,
        }
    }
}

pub struct PendingReviewPost {
    content: String,
}

impl PendingReviewPost {
    pub fn approve(self) -> Post {
        Post {
            content: self.content,
        }
    }
}

The ‘request_review’ and ‘approve’ methods take ownership of ‘self’,
thus consuming the ‘DraftPost’ and ‘PendingReviewPost’ instances and
transforming them into a ‘PendingReviewPost’ and a published ‘Post’,
respectively.  This way, we won't have any lingering ‘DraftPost’
instances after we've called ‘request_review’ on them, and so forth.
The ‘PendingReviewPost’ struct doesn't have a ‘content’ method defined
on it, so attempting to read its content results in a compiler error, as
with ‘DraftPost’.  Because the only way to get a published ‘Post’
instance that does have a ‘content’ method defined is to call the
‘approve’ method on a ‘PendingReviewPost’, and the only way to get a
‘PendingReviewPost’ is to call the ‘request_review’ method on a
‘DraftPost’, we've now encoded the blog post workflow into the type
system.

But we also have to make some small changes to ‘main’.  The
‘request_review’ and ‘approve’ methods return new instances rather than
modifying the struct they're called on, so we need to add more ‘let post
=’ shadowing assignments to save the returned instances.  We also can't
have the assertions about the draft and pending review posts' contents
be empty strings, nor do we need them: we can't compile code that tries
to use the content of posts in those states any longer.  The updated
code in ‘main’ is shown in Listing 18-21:

use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text("I ate a salad for lunch today");

    let post = post.request_review();

    let post = post.approve();

    assert_eq!("I ate a salad for lunch today", post.content());
}

The changes we needed to make to ‘main’ to reassign ‘post’ mean that
this implementation doesn't quite follow the object-oriented state
pattern anymore: the transformations between the states are no longer
encapsulated entirely within the ‘Post’ implementation.  However, our
gain is that invalid states are now impossible because of the type
system and the type checking that happens at compile time!  This ensures
that certain bugs, such as display of the content of an unpublished
post, will be discovered before they make it to production.

Try the tasks suggested at the start of this section on the ‘blog’ crate
as it is after Listing 18-21 to see what you think about the design of
this version of the code.  Note that some of the tasks might be
completed already in this design.

We've seen that even though Rust is capable of implementing
object-oriented design patterns, other patterns, such as encoding state
into the type system, are also available in Rust.  These patterns have
different trade-offs.  Although you might be very familiar with
object-oriented patterns, rethinking the problem to take advantage of
Rust's features can provide benefits, such as preventing some bugs at
compile time.  Object-oriented patterns won't always be the best
solution in Rust due to certain features, like ownership, that
object-oriented languages don't have.

20.1.4 Summary
--------------

No matter whether or not you think Rust is an object-oriented language
after reading this chapter, you now know that you can use trait objects
to get some object-oriented features in Rust.  Dynamic dispatch can give
your code some flexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance.
You can use this flexibility to implement object-oriented patterns that
can help your code's maintainability.  Rust also has other features,
like ownership, that object-oriented languages don't have.  An
object-oriented pattern won't always be the best way to take advantage
of Rust's strengths, but is an available option.

Next, we'll look at patterns, which are another of Rust's features that
enable lots of flexibility.  We've looked at them briefly throughout the
book but haven't seen their full capability yet.  Let's go!

21 Patterns and Matching
************************

‘Patterns’ are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the
structure of types, both complex and simple.  Using patterns in
conjunction with ‘match’ expressions and other constructs gives you more
control over a program's control flow.  A pattern consists of some
combination of the following:

   • Literals
   • Destructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples
   • Variables
   • Wildcards
   • Placeholders

Some example patterns include ‘x’, ‘(a, 3)’, and ‘Some(Color::Red)’.  In
the contexts in which patterns are valid, these components describe the
shape of data.  Our program then matches values against the patterns to
determine whether it has the correct shape of data to continue running a
particular piece of code.

To use a pattern, we compare it to some value.  If the pattern matches
the value, we use the value parts in our code.  Recall the ‘match’
expressions in Chapter 6 that used patterns, such as the coin-sorting
machine example.  If the value fits the shape of the pattern, we can use
the named pieces.  If it doesn't, the code associated with the pattern
won't run.

This chapter is a reference on all things related to patterns.  We'll
cover the valid places to use patterns, the difference between refutable
and irrefutable patterns, and the different kinds of pattern syntax that
you might see.  By the end of the chapter, you'll know how to use
patterns to express many concepts in a clear way.

21.1.1 ‘match’ Arms
-------------------

As discussed in Chapter 6, we use patterns in the arms of ‘match’
expressions.  Formally, ‘match’ expressions are defined as the keyword
‘match’, a value to match on, and one or more match arms that consist of
a pattern and an expression to run if the value matches that arm's
pattern, like this:

match VALUE {
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
}

For example, here's the ‘match’ expression from Listing 6-5 that matches
on an ‘Option<i32>’ value in the variable ‘x’:

match x {
    None => None,
    Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
}

The patterns in this ‘match’ expression are the ‘None’ and ‘Some(i)’ on
the left of each arrow.

One requirement for ‘match’ expressions is that they need to be
‘exhaustive’ in the sense that all possibilities for the value in the
‘match’ expression must be accounted for.  One way to ensure you've
covered every possibility is to have a catchall pattern for the last
arm: for example, a variable name matching any value can never fail and
thus covers every remaining case.

The particular pattern ‘_’ will match anything, but it never binds to a
variable, so it's often used in the last match arm.  The ‘_’ pattern can
be useful when you want to ignore any value not specified, for example.
We'll cover the ‘_’ pattern in more detail in the *note “Ignoring Values
in a Pattern”: Ignoring Values in a Pattern. section later in this
chapter.

21.1.1.1 Conditional ‘if let’ Expressions
.........................................

In Chapter 6 we discussed how to use ‘if let’ expressions mainly as a
shorter way to write the equivalent of a ‘match’ that only matches one
case.  Optionally, ‘if let’ can have a corresponding ‘else’ containing
code to run if the pattern in the ‘if let’ doesn't match.

Listing 19-1 shows that it's also possible to mix and match ‘if let’,
‘else if’, and ‘else if let’ expressions.  Doing so gives us more
flexibility than a ‘match’ expression in which we can express only one
value to compare with the patterns.  Also, Rust doesn't require that the
conditions in a series of ‘if let’, ‘else if’, ‘else if let’ arms relate
to each other.

The code in Listing 19-1 determines what color to make your background
based on a series of checks for several conditions.  For this example,
we've created variables with hardcoded values that a real program might
receive from user input.

fn main() {
    let favorite_color: Option<&str> = None;
    let is_tuesday = false;
    let age: Result<u8, _> = "34".parse();

    if let Some(color) = favorite_color {
        println!("Using your favorite color, {color}, as the background");
    } else if is_tuesday {
        println!("Tuesday is green day!");
    } else if let Ok(age) = age {
        if age > 30 {
            println!("Using purple as the background color");
        } else {
            println!("Using orange as the background color");
        }
    } else {
        println!("Using blue as the background color");
    }
}

If the user specifies a favorite color, that color is used as the
background.  If no favorite color is specified and today is Tuesday, the
background color is green.  Otherwise, if the user specifies their age
as a string and we can parse it as a number successfully, the color is
either purple or orange depending on the value of the number.  If none
of these conditions apply, the background color is blue.

This conditional structure lets us support complex requirements.  With
the hardcoded values we have here, this example will print ‘Using purple
as the background color’.

You can see that ‘if let’ can also introduce new variables which shadow
existing variables in the same way that ‘match’ arms can: the line ‘if
let Ok(age) = age’ introduces a new ‘age’ variable that contains the
value inside the ‘Ok’ variant, shadowing the existing ‘age’ variable.
This means we need to place the ‘if age > 30’ condition within that
block: we can't combine these two conditions into ‘if let Ok(age) = age
&& age > 30’.  The new ‘age’ we want to compare to 30 isn't valid until
the new scope starts with the curly bracket.

The downside of using ‘if let’ expressions is that the compiler doesn't
check for exhaustiveness, whereas with ‘match’ expressions it does.  If
we omitted the last ‘else’ block and therefore missed handling some
cases, the compiler would not alert us to the possible logic bug.

21.1.1.2 ‘while let’ Conditional Loops
......................................

Similar in construction to ‘if let’, the ‘while let’ conditional loop
allows a ‘while’ loop to run for as long as a pattern continues to
match.  We first saw a ‘while let’ loop in Chapter 17, where we used it
to keep looping as long as a stream produced new values.  Similarly, in
Listing 19-2 we show a ‘while let’ loop that waits on messages sent
between threads, but in this case checking a ‘Result’ instead of an
‘Option’.

    let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel();
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        for val in [1, 2, 3] {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
        }
    });

    while let Ok(value) = rx.recv() {
        println!("{value}");
    }

This example prints 1, 2, and 3.  When we saw ‘recv’ back in Chapter 16,
we unwrapped the error directly, or interacted with it as an iterator
using a ‘for’ loop.  As Listing 19-2 shows, though, we can also use
‘while let’, because the ‘recv’ method returns ‘Ok’ as long as the
sender is producing messages, and then produces an ‘Err’ once the sender
side disconnects.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: for Loops,  Next: let Statements,  Prev: while let Conditional Loops,  Up: All the Places Patterns Can Be Used

21.1.1.3 ‘for’ Loops
....................

In a ‘for’ loop, the value that directly follows the keyword ‘for’ is a
pattern.  For example, in ‘for x in y’ the ‘x’ is the pattern.  Listing
19-3 demonstrates how to use a pattern in a ‘for’ loop to destructure,
or break apart, a tuple as part of the ‘for’ loop.

    let v = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];

    for (index, value) in v.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{value} is at index {index}");
    }

The code in Listing 19-3 will print the following:

$ cargo run
   Compiling patterns v0.1.0 (file:///projects/patterns)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s
     Running `target/debug/patterns`
a is at index 0
b is at index 1
c is at index 2

We adapt an iterator using the ‘enumerate’ method so it produces a value
and the index for that value, placed into a tuple.  The first value
produced is the tuple ‘(0, 'a')’.  When this value is matched to the
pattern ‘(index, value)’, ‘index’ will be ‘0’ and ‘value’ will be ‘'a'’,
printing the first line of the output.

21.1.1.4 ‘let’ Statements
.........................

Prior to this chapter, we had only explicitly discussed using patterns
with ‘match’ and ‘if let’, but in fact, we've used patterns in other
places as well, including in ‘let’ statements.  For example, consider
this straightforward variable assignment with ‘let’:

let x = 5;

Every time you've used a ‘let’ statement like this you've been using
patterns, although you might not have realized it!  More formally, a
‘let’ statement looks like this:

let PATTERN = EXPRESSION;

In statements like ‘let x = 5;’ with a variable name in the ‘PATTERN’
slot, the variable name is just a particularly simple form of a pattern.
Rust compares the expression against the pattern and assigns any names
it finds.  So in the ‘let x = 5;’ example, ‘x’ is a pattern that means
“bind what matches here to the variable ‘x’.” Because the name ‘x’ is
the whole pattern, this pattern effectively means “bind everything to
the variable ‘x’, whatever the value is.”

To see the pattern matching aspect of ‘let’ more clearly, consider
Listing 19-4, which uses a pattern with ‘let’ to destructure a tuple.

    let (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3);

Here, we match a tuple against a pattern.  Rust compares the value ‘(1,
2, 3)’ to the pattern ‘(x, y, z)’ and sees that the value matches the
pattern, so Rust binds ‘1’ to ‘x’, ‘2’ to ‘y’, and ‘3’ to ‘z’.  You can
think of this tuple pattern as nesting three individual variable
patterns inside it.

If the number of elements in the pattern doesn't match the number of
elements in the tuple, the overall type won't match and we'll get a
compiler error.  For example, Listing 19-5 shows an attempt to
destructure a tuple with three elements into two variables, which won't
work.

    let (x, y) = (1, 2, 3);

Attempting to compile this code results in this type error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling patterns v0.1.0 (file:///projects/patterns)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:2:9
  |

  |         ^^^^^^   --------- this expression has type `({integer}, {integer}, {integer})`

             found tuple `(_, _)`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `patterns` (bin "patterns") due to 1 previous error

To fix the error, we could ignore one or more of the values in the tuple
using ‘_’ or ‘..’, as you'll see in the *note “Ignoring Values in a
Pattern”: Ignoring Values in a Pattern. section.  If the problem is that
we have too many variables in the pattern, the solution is to make the
types match by removing variables so the number of variables equals the
number of elements in the tuple.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Function Parameters,  Next: Refutability Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match,  Prev: let Statements,  Up: All the Places Patterns Can Be Used

21.1.1.5 Function Parameters
............................

Function parameters can also be patterns.  The code in Listing 19-6,
which declares a function named ‘foo’ that takes one parameter named ‘x’
of type ‘i32’, should by now look familiar.

fn foo(x: i32) {
    // code goes here
}

The ‘x’ part is a pattern!  As we did with ‘let’, we could match a tuple
in a function's arguments to the pattern.  Listing 19-7 splits the
values in a tuple as we pass it to a function.

fn print_coordinates(&(x, y): &(i32, i32)) {
    println!("Current location: ({x}, {y})");
}

fn main() {
    let point = (3, 5);
    print_coordinates(&point);
}

This code prints ‘Current location: (3, 5)’.  The values ‘&(3, 5)’ match
the pattern ‘&(x, y)’, so ‘x’ is the value ‘3’ and ‘y’ is the value ‘5’.

We can also use patterns in closure parameter lists in the same way as
in function parameter lists, because closures are similar to functions,
as discussed in Chapter 13.

At this point, you've seen several ways of using patterns, but patterns
don't work the same in every place we can use them.  In some places, the
patterns must be irrefutable; in other circumstances, they can be
refutable.  We'll discuss these two concepts next.

21.1.2 Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match
----------------------------------------------------------

Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable.  Patterns that
will match for any possible value passed are ‘irrefutable’.  An example
would be ‘x’ in the statement ‘let x = 5;’ because ‘x’ matches anything
and therefore cannot fail to match.  Patterns that can fail to match for
some possible value are ‘refutable’.  An example would be ‘Some(x)’ in
the expression ‘if let Some(x) = a_value’ because if the value in the
‘a_value’ variable is ‘None’ rather than ‘Some’, the ‘Some(x)’ pattern
will not match.

Function parameters, ‘let’ statements, and ‘for’ loops can only accept
irrefutable patterns, because the program cannot do anything meaningful
when values don't match.  The ‘if let’ and ‘while let’ expressions
accept refutable and irrefutable patterns, but the compiler warns
against irrefutable patterns because by definition they're intended to
handle possible failure: the functionality of a conditional is in its
ability to perform differently depending on success or failure.

In general, you shouldn't have to worry about the distinction between
refutable and irrefutable patterns; however, you do need to be familiar
with the concept of refutability so you can respond when you see it in
an error message.  In those cases, you'll need to change either the
pattern or the construct you're using the pattern with, depending on the
intended behavior of the code.

Let's look at an example of what happens when we try to use a refutable
pattern where Rust requires an irrefutable pattern and vice versa.
Listing 19-8 shows a ‘let’ statement, but for the pattern we've
specified ‘Some(x)’, a refutable pattern.  As you might expect, this
code will not compile.

    let Some(x) = some_option_value;

If ‘some_option_value’ was a ‘None’ value, it would fail to match the
pattern ‘Some(x)’, meaning the pattern is refutable.  However, the ‘let’
statement can only accept an irrefutable pattern because there is
nothing valid the code can do with a ‘None’ value.  At compile time,
Rust will complain that we've tried to use a refutable pattern where an
irrefutable pattern is required:

$ cargo run
   Compiling patterns v0.1.0 (file:///projects/patterns)

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0005`.
error: could not compile `patterns` (bin "patterns") due to 1 previous error

Because we didn't cover (and couldn't cover!)  every valid value with
the pattern ‘Some(x)’, Rust rightfully produces a compiler error.

If we have a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is needed,
we can fix it by changing the code that uses the pattern: instead of
using ‘let’, we can use ‘if let’.  Then if the pattern doesn't match,
the code will just skip the code in the curly brackets, giving it a way
to continue validly.  Listing 19-9 shows how to fix the code in Listing
19-8.

    if let Some(x) = some_option_value {
        println!("{x}");
    }

We've given the code an out!  This code is perfectly valid now.
However, if we give ‘if let’ an irrefutable pattern (a pattern that will
always match), such as ‘x’, as shown in Listing 19-10, the compiler will
give a warning.

    if let x = 5 {
        println!("{x}");
    };

Rust complains that it doesn't make sense to use ‘if let’ with an
irrefutable pattern:

$ cargo run
   Compiling patterns v0.1.0 (file:///projects/patterns)
warning: irrefutable `if let` pattern
 --> src/main.rs:2:8

For this reason, match arms must use refutable patterns, except for the
last arm, which should match any remaining values with an irrefutable
pattern.  Rust allows us to use an irrefutable pattern in a ‘match’ with
only one arm, but this syntax isn't particularly useful and could be
replaced with a simpler ‘let’ statement.

Now that you know where to use patterns and the difference between
refutable and irrefutable patterns, let's cover all the syntax we can
use to create patterns.

why and when you might want to use each one.

21.1.3.1 Matching Literals
..........................

As you saw in Chapter 6, you can match patterns against literals
directly.  The following code gives some examples:

    let x = 1;

    match x {
        1 => println!("one"),
        2 => println!("two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }

This code prints ‘one’ because the value in ‘x’ is 1.  This syntax is
useful when you want your code to take an action if it gets a particular
concrete value.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Matching Named Variables,  Next: Multiple Patterns,  Prev: Matching Literals,  Up: Pattern Syntax

21.1.3.2 Matching Named Variables
.................................

Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, and we've
used them many times in the book.  However, there is a complication when
you use named variables in ‘match’ expressions.  Because ‘match’ starts
a new scope, variables declared as part of a pattern inside the ‘match’
expression will shadow those with the same name outside the ‘match’
construct, as is the case with all variables.  In Listing 19-11, we
declare a variable named ‘x’ with the value ‘Some(5)’ and a variable ‘y’
with the value ‘10’.  We then create a ‘match’ expression on the value
‘x’.  Look at the patterns in the match arms and ‘println!’ at the end,
and try to figure out what the code will print before running this code
or reading further.

    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;

    match x {
        Some(50) => println!("Got 50"),
        Some(y) => println!("Matched, y = {y}"),
        _ => println!("Default case, x = {x:?}"),
    }

    println!("at the end: x = {x:?}, y = {y}");

Let's walk through what happens when the ‘match’ expression runs.  The
pattern in the first match arm doesn't match the defined value of ‘x’,
so the code continues.

The pattern in the second match arm introduces a new variable named ‘y’
that will match any value inside a ‘Some’ value.  Because we're in a new
scope inside the ‘match’ expression, this is a new ‘y’ variable, not the
‘y’ we declared at the beginning with the value 10.  This new ‘y’
binding will match any value inside a ‘Some’, which is what we have in
‘x’.  Therefore, this new ‘y’ binds to the inner value of the ‘Some’ in
‘x’.  That value is ‘5’, so the expression for that arm executes and
prints ‘Matched, y = 5’.

If ‘x’ had been a ‘None’ value instead of ‘Some(5)’, the patterns in the
first two arms wouldn't have matched, so the value would have matched to
the underscore.  We didn't introduce the ‘x’ variable in the pattern of
the underscore arm, so the ‘x’ in the expression is still the outer ‘x’
that hasn't been shadowed.  In this hypothetical case, the ‘match’ would
print ‘Default case, x = None’.

When the ‘match’ expression is done, its scope ends, and so does the
scope of the inner ‘y’.  The last ‘println!’ produces ‘at the end: x =
Some(5), y = 10’.

To create a ‘match’ expression that compares the values of the outer ‘x’
and ‘y’, rather than introducing a new variable which shadows the
existing ‘y’ variable, we would need to use a match guard conditional
instead.  We'll talk about match guards later in the *note “Extra
Conditionals with Match Guards”: Extra Conditionals with Match Guards.
section.

21.1.3.3 Multiple Patterns
..........................

In ‘match’ expressions, you can match multiple patterns using the ‘|’
syntax, which is the pattern ‘or’ operator.  For example, in the
following code we match the value of ‘x’ against the match arms, the
first of which has an ‘or’ option, meaning if the value of ‘x’ matches
either of the values in that arm, that arm's code will run:

    let x = 1;

    match x {
        1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }

This code prints ‘one or two’.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Matching Ranges of Values with =,  Next: Destructuring to Break Apart Values,  Prev: Multiple Patterns,  Up: Pattern Syntax

21.1.3.4 Matching Ranges of Values with ‘..=’
.............................................

The ‘..=’ syntax allows us to match to an inclusive range of values.  In
the following code, when a pattern matches any of the values within the
given range, that arm will execute:

    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1..=5 => println!("one through five"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }

If ‘x’ is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the first arm will match.  This syntax is
more convenient for multiple match values than using the ‘|’ operator to
express the same idea; if we were to use ‘|’ we would have to specify ‘1
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5’.  Specifying a range is much shorter, especially if we
want to match, say, any number between 1 and 1,000!

The compiler checks that the range isn't empty at compile time, and
because the only types for which Rust can tell if a range is empty or
not are ‘char’ and numeric values, ranges are only allowed with numeric
or ‘char’ values.

Here is an example using ranges of ‘char’ values:

    let x = 'c';

    match x {
        'a'..='j' => println!("early ASCII letter"),
        'k'..='z' => println!("late ASCII letter"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }

Rust can tell that ‘'c'’ is within the first pattern's range and prints
‘early ASCII letter’.

21.1.3.5 Destructuring to Break Apart Values
............................................

We can also use patterns to destructure structs, enums, and tuples to
use different parts of these values.  Let's walk through each value.
Destructuring Structs Listing 19-12 shows a ‘Point’ struct with two
fields, ‘x’ and ‘y’, that we can break apart using a pattern with a
‘let’ statement.

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    let Point { x: a, y: b } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, a);
    assert_eq!(7, b);
}

This code creates the variables ‘a’ and ‘b’ that match the values of the
‘x’ and ‘y’ fields of the ‘p’ struct.  This example shows that the names
of the variables in the pattern don't have to match the field names of
the struct.  However, it's common to match the variable names to the
field names to make it easier to remember which variables came from
which fields.  Because of this common usage, and because writing ‘let
Point { x: x, y: y } = p;’ contains a lot of duplication, Rust has a
shorthand for patterns that match struct fields: you only need to list
the name of the struct field, and the variables created from the pattern
will have the same names.  Listing 19-13 behaves in the same way as the
code in Listing 19-12, but the variables created in the ‘let’ pattern
are ‘x’ and ‘y’ instead of ‘a’ and ‘b’.

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    let Point { x, y } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, x);
    assert_eq!(7, y);
}

This code creates the variables ‘x’ and ‘y’ that match the ‘x’ and ‘y’
fields of the ‘p’ variable.  The outcome is that the variables ‘x’ and
‘y’ contain the values from the ‘p’ struct.

We can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct
pattern rather than creating variables for all the fields.  Doing so
allows us to test some of the fields for particular values while
creating variables to destructure the other fields.

In Listing 19-14, we have a ‘match’ expression that separates ‘Point’
values into three cases: points that lie directly on the ‘x’ axis (which
is true when ‘y = 0’), on the ‘y’ axis (‘x = 0’), or neither.

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {x}"),
        Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the y axis at {y}"),
        Point { x, y } => {
            println!("On neither axis: ({x}, {y})");
        }
    }
}

The first arm will match any point that lies on the ‘x’ axis by
specifying that the ‘y’ field matches if its value matches the literal
‘0’.  The pattern still creates an ‘x’ variable that we can use in the
code for this arm.

Similarly, the second arm matches any point on the ‘y’ axis by
specifying that the ‘x’ field matches if its value is ‘0’ and creates a
variable ‘y’ for the value of the ‘y’ field.  The third arm doesn't
specify any literals, so it matches any other ‘Point’ and creates
variables for both the ‘x’ and ‘y’ fields.

In this example, the value ‘p’ matches the second arm by virtue of ‘x’
containing a 0, so this code will print ‘On the y axis at 7’.

Remember that a ‘match’ expression stops checking arms once it has found
the first matching pattern, so even though ‘Point { x: 0, y: 0}’ is on
the ‘x’ axis and the ‘y’ axis, this code would only print ‘On the x axis
at 0’.  Destructuring Enums We've destructured enums in this book (for
example, Listing 6-5 in Chapter 6), but haven't yet explicitly discussed
that the pattern to destructure an enum corresponds to the way the data
stored within the enum is defined.  As an example, in Listing 19-15 we
use the ‘Message’ enum from Listing 6-2 and write a ‘match’ with
patterns that will destructure each inner value.

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);

    match msg {
        Message::Quit => {
            println!("The Quit variant has no data to destructure.");
        }
        Message::Move { x, y } => {
            println!("Move in the x direction {x} and in the y direction {y}");
        }
        Message::Write(text) => {
            println!("Text message: {text}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => {
            println!("Change the color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}");
        }
    }
}

This code will print ‘Change the color to red 0, green 160, and blue
255’.  Try changing the value of ‘msg’ to see the code from the other
arms run.

For enum variants without any data, like ‘Message::Quit’, we can't
destructure the value any further.  We can only match on the literal
‘Message::Quit’ value, and no variables are in that pattern.

For struct-like enum variants, such as ‘Message::Move’, we can use a
pattern similar to the pattern we specify to match structs.  After the
variant name, we place curly brackets and then list the fields with
variables so we break apart the pieces to use in the code for this arm.
Here we use the shorthand form as we did in Listing 19-13.

For tuple-like enum variants, like ‘Message::Write’ that holds a tuple
with one element and ‘Message::ChangeColor’ that holds a tuple with
three elements, the pattern is similar to the pattern we specify to
match tuples.  The number of variables in the pattern must match the
number of elements in the variant we're matching.  Destructuring Nested
Structs and Enums So far, our examples have all been matching structs or
enums one level deep, but matching can work on nested items too!  For
example, we can refactor the code in Listing 19-15 to support RGB and
HSV colors in the ‘ChangeColor’ message, as shown in Listing 19-16.

enum Color {
    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),
    Hsv(i32, i32, i32),
}

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(Color),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(0, 160, 255));

    match msg {
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(r, g, b)) => {
            println!("Change color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(h, s, v)) => {
            println!("Change color to hue {h}, saturation {s}, value {v}");
        }
        _ => (),
    }
}

The pattern of the first arm in the ‘match’ expression matches a
‘Message::ChangeColor’ enum variant that contains a ‘Color::Rgb’
variant; then the pattern binds to the three inner ‘i32’ values.  The
pattern of the second arm also matches a ‘Message::ChangeColor’ enum
variant, but the inner enum matches ‘Color::Hsv’ instead.  We can
specify these complex conditions in one ‘match’ expression, even though
two enums are involved.  Destructuring Structs and Tuples We can mix,
match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex ways.  The
following example shows a complicated destructure where we nest structs
and tuples inside a tuple and destructure all the primitive values out:

    let ((feet, inches), Point { x, y }) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });

This code lets us break complex types into their component parts so we
can use the values we're interested in separately.

Destructuring with patterns is a convenient way to use pieces of values,
such as the value from each field in a struct, separately from each
other.

21.1.3.6 Ignoring Values in a Pattern
.....................................

You've seen that it's sometimes useful to ignore values in a pattern,
such as in the last arm of a ‘match’, to get a catchall that doesn't
actually do anything but does account for all remaining possible values.
There are a few ways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a
pattern: using the ‘_’ pattern (which you've seen), using the ‘_’
pattern within another pattern, using a name that starts with an
underscore, or using ‘..’ to ignore remaining parts of a value.  Let's
explore how and why to use each of these patterns.  Ignoring an Entire
Value with ‘_’ We've used the underscore as a wildcard pattern that will
match any value but not bind to the value.  This is especially useful as
the last arm in a ‘match’ expression, but we can also use it in any
pattern, including function parameters, as shown in Listing 19-17.

fn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("This code only uses the y parameter: {y}");
}

fn main() {
    foo(3, 4);
}

This code will completely ignore the value ‘3’ passed as the first
argument, and will print ‘This code only uses the y parameter: 4’.

In most cases when you no longer need a particular function parameter,
you would change the signature so it doesn't include the unused
parameter.  Ignoring a function parameter can be especially useful in
cases when, for example, you're implementing a trait when you need a
certain type signature but the function body in your implementation
doesn't need one of the parameters.  You then avoid getting a compiler
warning about unused function parameters, as you would if you used a
name instead.  Ignoring Parts of a Value with a Nested ‘_’ We can also
use ‘_’ inside another pattern to ignore just part of a value, for
example, when we want to test for only part of a value but have no use
for the other parts in the corresponding code we want to run.  Listing
19-18 shows code responsible for managing a setting's value.  The
business requirements are that the user should not be allowed to
overwrite an existing customization of a setting but can unset the
setting and give it a value if it is currently unset.

    let mut setting_value = Some(5);
    let new_setting_value = Some(10);

    match (setting_value, new_setting_value) {
        (Some(_), Some(_)) => {
            println!("Can't overwrite an existing customized value");
        }
        _ => {
            setting_value = new_setting_value;
        }
    }

    println!("setting is {setting_value:?}");

This code will print ‘Can't overwrite an existing customized value’ and
then ‘setting is Some(5)’.  In the first match arm, we don't need to
match on or use the values inside either ‘Some’ variant, but we do need
to test for the case when ‘setting_value’ and ‘new_setting_value’ are
the ‘Some’ variant.  In that case, we print the reason for not changing
‘setting_value’, and it doesn't get changed.

In all other cases (if either ‘setting_value’ or ‘new_setting_value’ are
‘None’) expressed by the ‘_’ pattern in the second arm, we want to allow
‘new_setting_value’ to become ‘setting_value’.

We can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to
ignore particular values.  Listing 19-19 shows an example of ignoring
the second and fourth values in a tuple of five items.

    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

    match numbers {
        (first, _, third, _, fifth) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {third}, {fifth}")
        }
    }

This code will print ‘Some numbers: 2, 8, 32’, and the values 4 and 16
will be ignored.  Ignoring an Unused Variable by Starting Its Name with
‘_’ If you create a variable but don't use it anywhere, Rust will
usually issue a warning because an unused variable could be a bug.
However, sometimes it's useful to be able to create a variable you won't
use yet, such as when you're prototyping or just starting a project.  In
this situation, you can tell Rust not to warn you about the unused
variable by starting the name of the variable with an underscore.  In
Listing 19-20, we create two unused variables, but when we compile this
code, we should only get a warning about one of them.

fn main() {
    let _x = 5;
    let y = 10;
}

Here we get a warning about not using the variable ‘y’, but we don't get
a warning about not using ‘_x’.

Note that there is a subtle difference between using only ‘_’ and using
a name that starts with an underscore.  The syntax ‘_x’ still binds the
value to the variable, whereas ‘_’ doesn't bind at all.  To show a case
where this distinction matters, Listing 19-21 will provide us with an
error.

    let s = Some(String::from("Hello!"));

    if let Some(_s) = s {
        println!("found a string");
    }

    println!("{s:?}");

We'll receive an error because the ‘s’ value will still be moved into
‘_s’, which prevents us from using ‘s’ again.  However, using the
underscore by itself doesn't ever bind to the value.  Listing 19-22 will
compile without any errors because ‘s’ doesn't get moved into ‘_’.

    let s = Some(String::from("Hello!"));

    if let Some(_) = s {
        println!("found a string");
    }

    println!("{s:?}");

This code works just fine because we never bind ‘s’ to anything; it
isn't moved.  Ignoring Remaining Parts of a Value with ‘..’ With values
that have many parts, we can use the ‘..’ syntax to use specific parts
and ignore the rest, avoiding the need to list underscores for each
ignored value.  The ‘..’ pattern ignores any parts of a value that we
haven't explicitly matched in the rest of the pattern.  In Listing
19-23, we have a ‘Point’ struct that holds a coordinate in
three-dimensional space.  In the ‘match’ expression, we want to operate
only on the ‘x’ coordinate and ignore the values in the ‘y’ and ‘z’
fields.

    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
        z: i32,
    }

    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };

    match origin {
        Point { x, .. } => println!("x is {x}"),
    }

We list the ‘x’ value and then just include the ‘..’ pattern.  This is
quicker than having to list ‘y: _’ and ‘z: _’, particularly when we're
working with structs that have lots of fields in situations where only
one or two fields are relevant.

The syntax ‘..’ will expand to as many values as it needs to be.
Listing 19-24 shows how to use ‘..’ with a tuple.

fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

    match numbers {
        (first, .., last) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {last}");
        }
    }
}

In this code, the first and last value are matched with ‘first’ and
‘last’.  The ‘..’ will match and ignore everything in the middle.

However, using ‘..’ must be unambiguous.  If it is unclear which values
are intended for matching and which should be ignored, Rust will give us
an error.  Listing 19-25 shows an example of using ‘..’ ambiguously, so
it will not compile.

fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

    match numbers {
        (.., second, ..) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {second}")
        },
    }
}

When we compile this example, we get this error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling patterns v0.1.0 (file:///projects/patterns)
error: `..` can only be used once per tuple pattern
 --> src/main.rs:5:22
  |
5 |         (.., second, ..) => {
  |          --          ^^ can only be used once per tuple pattern
  |          |
  |          previously used here

error: could not compile `patterns` (bin "patterns") due to 1 previous error

It's impossible for Rust to determine how many values in the tuple to
ignore before matching a value with ‘second’ and then how many further
values to ignore thereafter.  This code could mean that we want to
ignore ‘2’, bind ‘second’ to ‘4’, and then ignore ‘8’, ‘16’, and ‘32’;
or that we want to ignore ‘2’ and ‘4’, bind ‘second’ to ‘8’, and then
ignore ‘16’ and ‘32’; and so forth.  The variable name ‘second’ doesn't
mean anything special to Rust, so we get a compiler error because using
‘..’ in two places like this is ambiguous.

21.1.3.7 Extra Conditionals with Match Guards
.............................................

A ‘match guard’ is an additional ‘if’ condition, specified after the
pattern in a ‘match’ arm, that must also match for that arm to be
chosen.  Match guards are useful for expressing more complex ideas than
a pattern alone allows.

The condition can use variables created in the pattern.  Listing 19-26
shows a ‘match’ where the first arm has the pattern ‘Some(x)’ and also
has a match guard of ‘if x % 2 == 0’ (which will be true if the number
is even).

    let num = Some(4);

    match num {
        Some(x) if x % 2 == 0 => println!("The number {x} is even"),
        Some(x) => println!("The number {x} is odd"),
        None => (),
    }

This example will print ‘The number 4 is even’.  When ‘num’ is compared
to the pattern in the first arm, it matches, because ‘Some(4)’ matches
‘Some(x)’.  Then the match guard checks whether the remainder of
dividing ‘x’ by 2 is equal to 0, and because it is, the first arm is
selected.

If ‘num’ had been ‘Some(5)’ instead, the match guard in the first arm
would have been false because the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1,
which is not equal to 0.  Rust would then go to the second arm, which
would match because the second arm doesn't have a match guard and
therefore matches any ‘Some’ variant.

There is no way to express the ‘if x % 2 == 0’ condition within a
pattern, so the match guard gives us the ability to express this logic.
The downside of this additional expressiveness is that the compiler
doesn't try to check for exhaustiveness when match guard expressions are
involved.

In Listing 19-11, we mentioned that we could use match guards to solve
our pattern-shadowing problem.  Recall that we created a new variable
inside the pattern in the ‘match’ expression instead of using the
variable outside the ‘match’.  That new variable meant we couldn't test
against the value of the outer variable.  Listing 19-27 shows how we can
use a match guard to fix this problem.

fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;

    match x {
        Some(50) => println!("Got 50"),
        Some(n) if n == y => println!("Matched, n = {n}"),
        _ => println!("Default case, x = {x:?}"),
    }

    println!("at the end: x = {x:?}, y = {y}");
}

This code will now print ‘Default case, x = Some(5)’.  The pattern in
the second match arm doesn't introduce a new variable ‘y’ that would
shadow the outer ‘y’, meaning we can use the outer ‘y’ in the match
guard.  Instead of specifying the pattern as ‘Some(y)’, which would have
shadowed the outer ‘y’, we specify ‘Some(n)’.  This creates a new
variable ‘n’ that doesn't shadow anything because there is no ‘n’
variable outside the ‘match’.

The match guard ‘if n == y’ is not a pattern and therefore doesn't
introduce new variables.  This ‘y’ ‘is’ the outer ‘y’ rather than a new
‘y’ shadowing it, and we can look for a value that has the same value as
the outer ‘y’ by comparing ‘n’ to ‘y’.

You can also use the ‘or’ operator ‘|’ in a match guard to specify
multiple patterns; the match guard condition will apply to all the
patterns.  Listing 19-28 shows the precedence when combining a pattern
that uses ‘|’ with a match guard.  The important part of this example is
that the ‘if y’ match guard applies to ‘4’, ‘5’, ‘and’ ‘6’, even though
it might look like ‘if y’ only applies to ‘6’.

    let x = 4;
    let y = false;

    match x {
        4 | 5 | 6 if y => println!("yes"),
        _ => println!("no"),
    }

The match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of ‘x’
is equal to ‘4’, ‘5’, or ‘6’ ‘and’ if ‘y’ is ‘true’.  When this code
runs, the pattern of the first arm matches because ‘x’ is ‘4’, but the
match guard ‘if y’ is false, so the first arm is not chosen.  The code
moves on to the second arm, which does match, and this program prints
‘no’.  The reason is that the ‘if’ condition applies to the whole
pattern ‘4 | 5 | 6’, not only to the last value ‘6’.  In other words,
the precedence of a match guard in relation to a pattern behaves like
this:

(4 | 5 | 6) if y => ...

rather than this:

4 | 5 | (6 if y) => ...

After running the code, the precedence behavior is evident: if the match
guard were applied only to the final value in the list of values
specified using the ‘|’ operator, the arm would have matched and the
program would have printed ‘yes’.

21.1.3.8 ‘@’ Bindings
.....................

The ‘at’ operator ‘@’ lets us create a variable that holds a value at
the same time as we're testing that value for a pattern match.  In
Listing 19-29, we want to test that a ‘Message::Hello’ ‘id’ field is
within the range ‘3..=7’.  We also want to bind the value to the
variable ‘id_variable’ so we can use it in the code associated with the
arm.  We could name this variable ‘id’, the same as the field, but for
this example we'll use a different name.

    enum Message {
        Hello { id: i32 },
    }

    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };

    match msg {
        Message::Hello {
            id: id_variable @ 3..=7,
        } => println!("Found an id in range: {id_variable}"),
        Message::Hello { id: 10..=12 } => {
            println!("Found an id in another range")
        }
        Message::Hello { id } => println!("Found some other id: {id}"),
    }

This example will print ‘Found an id in range: 5’.  By specifying
‘id_variable @’ before the range ‘3..=7’, we're capturing whatever value
matched the range while also testing that the value matched the range
pattern.

In the second arm, where we only have a range specified in the pattern,
the code associated with the arm doesn't have a variable that contains
the actual value of the ‘id’ field.  The ‘id’ field's value could have
been 10, 11, or 12, but the code that goes with that pattern doesn't
know which it is.  The pattern code isn't able to use the value from the
‘id’ field, because we haven't saved the ‘id’ value in a variable.

In the last arm, where we've specified a variable without a range, we do
have the value available to use in the arm's code in a variable named
‘id’.  The reason is that we've used the struct field shorthand syntax.
But we haven't applied any test to the value in the ‘id’ field in this
arm, as we did with the first two arms: any value would match this
pattern.

Using ‘@’ lets us test a value and save it in a variable within one
pattern.

21.1.4 Summary
--------------

Rust's patterns are very useful in distinguishing between different
kinds of data.  When used in ‘match’ expressions, Rust ensures your
patterns cover every possible value, or your program won't compile.
Patterns in ‘let’ statements and function parameters make those
constructs more useful, enabling the destructuring of values into
smaller parts at the same time as assigning to variables.  We can create
simple or complex patterns to suit our needs.

Next, for the penultimate chapter of the book, we'll look at some
advanced aspects of a variety of Rust's features.

22 Advanced Features
********************

By now, you've learned the most commonly used parts of the Rust
programming language.  Before we do one more project in Chapter 21,
we'll look at a few aspects of the language you might run into every
once in a while, but may not use every day.  You can use this chapter as
a reference for when you encounter any unknowns.  The features covered
here are useful in very specific situations.  Although you might not
reach for them often, we want to make sure you have a grasp of all the
features Rust has to offer.

In this chapter, we'll cover:

   • Unsafe Rust: how to opt out of some of Rust's guarantees and take
     responsibility for manually upholding those guarantees
   • Advanced traits: associated types, default type parameters, fully
     qualified syntax, supertraits, and the newtype pattern in relation
     to traits
   • Advanced types: more about the newtype pattern, type aliases, the
     never type, and dynamically sized types
   • Advanced functions and closures: function pointers and returning
     closures
   • Macros: ways to define code that defines more code at compile time

It's a panoply of Rust features with something for everyone!  Let's dive
in!

22.1 Unsafe Rust
================

All the code we've discussed so far has had Rust's memory safety
guarantees enforced at compile time.  However, Rust has a second
language hidden inside it that doesn't enforce these memory safety
guarantees: it's called ‘unsafe Rust’ and works just like regular Rust,
but gives us extra superpowers.

Unsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative.
When the compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the
guarantees, it's better for it to reject some valid programs than to
accept some invalid programs.  Although the code ‘might’ be okay, if the
Rust compiler doesn't have enough information to be confident, it will
reject the code.  In these cases, you can use unsafe code to tell the
compiler, “Trust me, I know what I'm doing.” Be warned, however, that
you use unsafe Rust at your own risk: if you use unsafe code
incorrectly, problems can occur due to memory unsafety, such as null
pointer dereferencing.

Another reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying
computer hardware is inherently unsafe.  If Rust didn't let you do
unsafe operations, you couldn't do certain tasks.  Rust needs to allow
you to do low-level systems programming, such as directly interacting
with the operating system or even writing your own operating system.
Working with low-level systems programming is one of the goals of the
language.  Let's explore what we can do with unsafe Rust and how to do
it.

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Unsafe Superpowers,  Next: Dereferencing a Raw Pointer,  Prev: Unsafe Rust,  Up: Unsafe Rust

22.1.1 Unsafe Superpowers
-------------------------

To switch to unsafe Rust, use the ‘unsafe’ keyword and then start a new
block that holds the unsafe code.  You can take five actions in unsafe
Rust that you can't in safe Rust, which we call ‘unsafe superpowers’.
Those superpowers include the ability to:

   • Dereference a raw pointer
   • Call an unsafe function or method
   • Access or modify a mutable static variable
   • Implement an unsafe trait
   • Access fields of a ‘union’

It's important to understand that ‘unsafe’ doesn't turn off the borrow
checker or disable any other of Rust's safety checks: if you use a
reference in unsafe code, it will still be checked.  The ‘unsafe’
keyword only gives you access to these five features that are then not
checked by the compiler for memory safety.  You'll still get some degree
of safety inside of an unsafe block.

In addition, ‘unsafe’ does not mean the code inside the block is
necessarily dangerous or that it will definitely have memory safety
problems: the intent is that as the programmer, you'll ensure the code
inside an ‘unsafe’ block will access memory in a valid way.

People are fallible, and mistakes will happen, but by requiring these
five unsafe operations to be inside blocks annotated with ‘unsafe’
you'll know that any errors related to memory safety must be within an
‘unsafe’ block.  Keep ‘unsafe’ blocks small; you'll be thankful later
when you investigate memory bugs.

To isolate unsafe code as much as possible, it's best to enclose unsafe
code within a safe abstraction and provide a safe API, which we'll
discuss later in the chapter when we examine unsafe functions and
methods.  Parts of the standard library are implemented as safe
abstractions over unsafe code that has been audited.  Wrapping unsafe
code in a safe abstraction prevents uses of ‘unsafe’ from leaking out
into all the places that you or your users might want to use the
functionality implemented with ‘unsafe’ code, because using a safe
abstraction is safe.

Let's look at each of the five unsafe superpowers in turn.  We'll also
look at some abstractions that provide a safe interface to unsafe code.

22.1.1.1 Dereferencing a Raw Pointer
....................................

In Chapter 4, in the *note “Dangling References”: Dangling References.
section, we mentioned that the compiler ensures references are always
valid.  Unsafe Rust has two new types called ‘raw pointers’ that are
similar to references.  As with references, raw pointers can be
immutable or mutable and are written as ‘*const T’ and ‘*mut T’,
respectively.  The asterisk isn't the dereference operator; it's part of
the type name.  In the context of raw pointers, ‘immutable’ means that
the pointer can't be directly assigned to after being dereferenced.

Different from references and smart pointers, raw pointers:

   • Are allowed to ignore the borrowing rules by having both immutable
     and mutable pointers or multiple mutable pointers to the same
     location
   • Aren't guaranteed to point to valid memory
   • Are allowed to be null
   • Don't implement any automatic cleanup

By opting out of having Rust enforce these guarantees, you can give up
guaranteed safety in exchange for greater performance or the ability to
interface with another language or hardware where Rust's guarantees
don't apply.

Listing 20-1 shows how to create an immutable and a mutable raw pointer.

    let mut num = 5;

    let r1 = &raw const num;
    let r2 = &raw mut num;

Notice that we don't include the ‘unsafe’ keyword in this code.  We can
create raw pointers in safe code; we just can't dereference raw pointers
outside an unsafe block, as you'll see in a bit.

We've created raw pointers by using the raw borrow operators: ‘&raw
const num’ creates a ‘*const i32’ immutable raw pointer, and ‘&raw mut
num’ creates a ‘*mut i32’ mutable raw pointer.  Because we created them
directly from a local variable, we know these particular raw pointers
are valid, but we can't make that assumption about just any raw pointer.

To demonstrate this, next we'll create a raw pointer whose validity we
can't be so certain of, using ‘as’ to cast a value instead of using the
raw reference operators.  Listing 20-2 shows how to create a raw pointer
to an arbitrary location in memory.  Trying to use arbitrary memory is
undefined: there might be data at that address or there might not, the
compiler might optimize the code so there is no memory access, or the
program might error with a segmentation fault.  Usually, there is no
good reason to write code like this, especially in cases where you can
use a raw borrow operator instead, but it is possible.

    let address = 0x012345usize;
    let r = address as *const i32;

Recall that we can create raw pointers in safe code, but we can't
‘dereference’ raw pointers and read the data being pointed to.  In
Listing 20-3, we use the dereference operator ‘*’ on a raw pointer that
requires an ‘unsafe’ block.

    let mut num = 5;

    let r1 = &raw const num;
    let r2 = &raw mut num;

    unsafe {
        println!("r1 is: {}", *r1);
        println!("r2 is: {}", *r2);
    }

Creating a pointer does no harm; it's only when we try to access the
value that it points at that we might end up dealing with an invalid
value.

Note also that in Listing 20-1 and 20-3, we created ‘*const i32’ and
‘*mut i32’ raw pointers that both pointed to the same memory location,
where ‘num’ is stored.  If we instead tried to create an immutable and a
mutable reference to ‘num’, the code would not have compiled because
Rust's ownership rules don't allow a mutable reference at the same time
as any immutable references.  With raw pointers, we can create a mutable
pointer and an immutable pointer to the same location and change data
through the mutable pointer, potentially creating a data race.  Be
careful!

With all of these dangers, why would you ever use raw pointers?  One
major use case is when interfacing with C code, as you'll see in the
next section, *note “Calling an Unsafe Function or Method”: Calling an
Unsafe Function or Method. Another case is when building up safe
abstractions that the borrow checker doesn't understand.  We'll
introduce unsafe functions and then look at an example of a safe
abstraction that uses unsafe code.

22.1.1.2 Calling an Unsafe Function or Method
.............................................

The second type of operation you can perform in an unsafe block is
calling unsafe functions.  Unsafe functions and methods look exactly
like regular functions and methods, but they have an extra ‘unsafe’
before the rest of the definition.  The ‘unsafe’ keyword in this context
indicates the function has requirements we need to uphold when we call
this function, because Rust can't guarantee we've met these
requirements.  By calling an unsafe function within an ‘unsafe’ block,
we're saying that we've read this function's documentation and take
responsibility for upholding the function's contracts.

Here is an unsafe function named ‘dangerous’ that doesn't do anything in
its body:

    unsafe fn dangerous() {}

    unsafe {
        dangerous();
    }

We must call the ‘dangerous’ function within a separate ‘unsafe’ block.
If we try to call ‘dangerous’ without the ‘unsafe’ block, we'll get an
error:

$ cargo run
   Compiling unsafe-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/unsafe-example)

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0133`.
error: could not compile `unsafe-example` (bin "unsafe-example") due to 1 previous error

With the ‘unsafe’ block, we're asserting to Rust that we've read the
function's documentation, we understand how to use it properly, and
we've verified that we're fulfilling the contract of the function.

Bodies of unsafe functions are effectively ‘unsafe’ blocks, so to
perform other unsafe operations within an unsafe function, we don't need
to add another ‘unsafe’ block.  Creating a Safe Abstraction over Unsafe
Code Just because a function contains unsafe code doesn't mean we need
to mark the entire function as unsafe.  In fact, wrapping unsafe code in
a safe function is a common abstraction.  As an example, let's study the
‘split_at_mut’ function from the standard library, which requires some
unsafe code.  We'll explore how we might implement it.  This safe method
is defined on mutable slices: it takes one slice and makes it two by
splitting the slice at the index given as an argument.  Listing 20-4
shows how to use ‘split_at_mut’.

    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    let r = &mut v[..];

    let (a, b) = r.split_at_mut(3);

    assert_eq!(a, &mut [1, 2, 3]);
    assert_eq!(b, &mut [4, 5, 6]);

We can't implement this function using only safe Rust.  An attempt might
look something like Listing 20-5, which won't compile.  For simplicity,
we'll implement ‘split_at_mut’ as a function rather than a method and
only for slices of ‘i32’ values rather than for a generic type ‘T’.

fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();

    assert!(mid <= len);

    (&mut values[..mid], &mut values[mid..])
}

This function first gets the total length of the slice.  Then it asserts
that the index given as a parameter is within the slice by checking
whether it's less than or equal to the length.  The assertion means that
if we pass an index that is greater than the length to split the slice
at, the function will panic before it attempts to use that index.

Then we return two mutable slices in a tuple: one from the start of the
original slice to the ‘mid’ index and another from ‘mid’ to the end of
the slice.

When we try to compile the code in Listing 20-5, we'll get an error.

error: could not compile `unsafe-example` (bin "unsafe-example") due to 1 previous error

Rust's borrow checker can't understand that we're borrowing different
parts of the slice; it only knows that we're borrowing from the same
slice twice.  Borrowing different parts of a slice is fundamentally okay
because the two slices aren't overlapping, but Rust isn't smart enough
to know this.  When we know code is okay, but Rust doesn't, it's time to
reach for unsafe code.

Listing 20-6 shows how to use an ‘unsafe’ block, a raw pointer, and some
calls to unsafe functions to make the implementation of ‘split_at_mut’
work.

use std::slice;

fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();
    let ptr = values.as_mut_ptr();

    assert!(mid <= len);

    unsafe {
        (
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid),
        )
    }
}

Recall from *note “The Slice Type”: The Slice Type. section in Chapter 4
that slices are a pointer to some data and the length of the slice.  We
use the ‘len’ method to get the length of a slice and the ‘as_mut_ptr’
method to access the raw pointer of a slice.  In this case, because we
have a mutable slice to ‘i32’ values, ‘as_mut_ptr’ returns a raw pointer
with the type ‘*mut i32’, which we've stored in the variable ‘ptr’.

We keep the assertion that the ‘mid’ index is within the slice.  Then we
get to the unsafe code: the ‘slice::from_raw_parts_mut’ function takes a
raw pointer and a length, and it creates a slice.  We use this function
to create a slice that starts from ‘ptr’ and is ‘mid’ items long.  Then
we call the ‘add’ method on ‘ptr’ with ‘mid’ as an argument to get a raw
pointer that starts at ‘mid’, and we create a slice using that pointer
and the remaining number of items after ‘mid’ as the length.

The function ‘slice::from_raw_parts_mut’ is unsafe because it takes a
raw pointer and must trust that this pointer is valid.  The ‘add’ method
on raw pointers is also unsafe, because it must trust that the offset
location is also a valid pointer.  Therefore, we had to put an ‘unsafe’
block around our calls to ‘slice::from_raw_parts_mut’ and ‘add’ so we
could call them.  By looking at the code and by adding the assertion
that ‘mid’ must be less than or equal to ‘len’, we can tell that all the
raw pointers used within the ‘unsafe’ block will be valid pointers to
data within the slice.  This is an acceptable and appropriate use of
‘unsafe’.

Note that we don't need to mark the resulting ‘split_at_mut’ function as
‘unsafe’, and we can call this function from safe Rust.  We've created a
safe abstraction to the unsafe code with an implementation of the
function that uses ‘unsafe’ code in a safe way, because it creates only
valid pointers from the data this function has access to.

In contrast, the use of ‘slice::from_raw_parts_mut’ in Listing 20-7
would likely crash when the slice is used.  This code takes an arbitrary
memory location and creates a slice 10,000 items long.

    use std::slice;

    let address = 0x01234usize;
    let r = address as *mut i32;

    let values: &[i32] = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts_mut(r, 10000) };

We don't own the memory at this arbitrary location, and there is no
guarantee that the slice this code creates contains valid ‘i32’ values.
Attempting to use ‘values’ as though it's a valid slice results in
undefined behavior.  Using ‘extern’ Functions to Call External Code
Sometimes, your Rust code might need to interact with code written in
another language.  For this, Rust has the keyword ‘extern’ that
facilitates the creation and use of a ‘Foreign Function Interface
(FFI)’.  An FFI is a way for a programming language to define functions
and enable a different (foreign) programming language to call those
functions.

Listing 20-8 demonstrates how to set up an integration with the ‘abs’
function from the C standard library.  Functions declared within
‘extern’ blocks are usually unsafe to call from Rust code, so they must
also be marked ‘unsafe’.  The reason is that other languages don't
enforce Rust's rules and guarantees, and Rust can't check them, so
responsibility falls on the programmer to ensure safety.

unsafe extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        println!("Absolute value of -3 according to C: {}", abs(-3));
    }
}

Within the ‘unsafe extern "C"’ block, we list the names and signatures
of external functions from another language we want to call.  The ‘"C"’
part defines which ‘application binary interface (ABI)’ the external
function uses: the ABI defines how to call the function at the assembly
level.  The ‘"C"’ ABI is the most common and follows the C programming
language's ABI.

This particular function does not have any memory safety considerations,
though.  In fact, we know that any call to ‘abs’ will always be safe for
any ‘i32’, so we can use the ‘safe’ keyword to say that this specific
function is safe to call even though it is in an ‘unsafe extern’ block.
Once we make that change, calling it no longer requires an ‘unsafe’
block, as shown in Listing 20-9.

unsafe extern "C" {
    safe fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    println!("Absolute value of -3 according to C: {}", abs(-3));
}

Marking a function as ‘safe’ does not inherently make it safe!  Instead,
it is like a promise you are making to Rust that it ‘is’ safe.  It is
still your responsibility to make sure that promise is kept!

Calling Rust Functions from Other Languages We can also use ‘extern’ to
create an interface that allows other languages to call Rust functions.
Instead of creating a whole ‘extern’ block, we add the ‘extern’ keyword
and specify the ABI to use just before the ‘fn’ keyword for the relevant
function.  We also need to add a ‘#[unsafe(no_mangle)]’ annotation to
tell the Rust compiler not to mangle the name of this function.
‘Mangling’ is when a compiler changes the name we've given a function to
a different name that contains more information for other parts of the
compilation process to consume but is less human readable.  Every
programming language compiler mangles names slightly differently, so for
a Rust function to be nameable by other languages, we must disable the
Rust compiler's name mangling.  This is unsafe because there might be
name collisions across libraries without the built-in mangling, so it is
our responsibility to make sure the name we have exported is safe to
export without mangling.

In the following example, we make the ‘call_from_c’ function accessible
from C code, after it's compiled to a shared library and linked from C:

pub extern "C" fn call_from_c() {
    println!("Just called a Rust function from C!");
}

This usage of ‘extern’ does not require ‘unsafe’.

22.1.1.3 Accessing or Modifying a Mutable Static Variable
.........................................................

In this book, we've not yet talked about ‘global variables’, which Rust
does support but can be problematic with Rust's ownership rules.  If two
threads are accessing the same mutable global variable, it can cause a
data race.

In Rust, global variables are called ‘static’ variables.  Listing 20-10
shows an example declaration and use of a static variable with a string
slice as a value.

static HELLO_WORLD: &str = "Hello, world!";

fn main() {
    println!("name is: {HELLO_WORLD}");
}

Static variables are similar to constants, which we discussed in the
*note “Differences Between Variables and Constants”: Constants. section
in Chapter 3.  The names of static variables are in
‘SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE’ by convention.  Static variables can only store
references with the ‘'static’ lifetime, which means the Rust compiler
can figure out the lifetime and we aren't required to annotate it
explicitly.  Accessing an immutable static variable is safe.

A subtle difference between constants and immutable static variables is
that values in a static variable have a fixed address in memory.  Using
the value will always access the same data.  Constants, on the other
hand, are allowed to duplicate their data whenever they're used.
Another difference is that static variables can be mutable.  Accessing
and modifying mutable static variables is ‘unsafe’.  Listing 20-11 shows
how to declare, access, and modify a mutable static variable named
‘COUNTER’.

static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;

/// SAFETY: Calling this from more than a single thread at a time is undefined
/// behavior, so you *must* guarantee you only call it from a single thread at
/// a time.
unsafe fn add_to_count(inc: u32) {
    COUNTER += inc;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        // SAFETY: This is only called from a single thread in `main`.
        add_to_count(3);
        println!("COUNTER: {}", COUNTER);
    }
}

As with regular variables, we specify mutability using the ‘mut’
keyword.  Any code that reads or writes from ‘COUNTER’ must be within an
‘unsafe’ block.  This code compiles and prints ‘COUNTER: 3’ as we would
expect because it's single threaded.  Having multiple threads access
‘COUNTER’ would likely result in data races, so it is undefined
behavior.  Therefore, we need to mark the entire function as ‘unsafe’,
and document the safety limitation, so anyone calling the function knows
what they are and are not allowed to do safely.

Whenever we write an unsafe function, it is idiomatic to write a comment
starting with ‘SAFETY’ and explaining what the caller needs to do to
call the function safely.  Likewise, whenever we perform an unsafe
operation, it is idiomatic to write a comment starting with ‘SAFETY’ to
explain how the safety rules are upheld.

With mutable data that is globally accessible, it's difficult to ensure
there are no data races, which is why Rust considers mutable static
variables to be unsafe.  Where possible, it's preferable to use the
concurrency techniques and thread-safe smart pointers we discussed in
Chapter 16 so the compiler checks that data accessed from different
threads is done safely.

22.1.1.4 Implementing an Unsafe Trait
.....................................

We can use ‘unsafe’ to implement an unsafe trait.  A trait is unsafe
when at least one of its methods has some invariant that the compiler
can't verify.  We declare that a trait is ‘unsafe’ by adding the
‘unsafe’ keyword before ‘trait’ and marking the implementation of the
trait as ‘unsafe’ too, as shown in Listing 20-12.

unsafe trait Foo {
    // methods go here
}

unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    // method implementations go here
}

fn main() {}

By using ‘unsafe impl’, we're promising that we'll uphold the invariants
that the compiler can't verify.

As an example, recall the ‘Sync’ and ‘Send’ marker traits we discussed
in the *note “Extensible Concurrency with the ‘Sync’ and ‘Send’ Traits”:
Extensible Concurrency with the Sync and Send Traits. section in Chapter
16: the compiler implements these traits automatically if our types are
composed entirely of ‘Send’ and ‘Sync’ types.  If we implement a type
that contains a type that is not ‘Send’ or ‘Sync’, such as raw pointers,
and we want to mark that type as ‘Send’ or ‘Sync’, we must use ‘unsafe’.
Rust can't verify that our type upholds the guarantees that it can be
safely sent across threads or accessed from multiple threads; therefore,
we need to do those checks manually and indicate as such with ‘unsafe’.

22.1.1.5 Accessing Fields of a Union
....................................

The final action that works only with ‘unsafe’ is accessing fields of a
‘union’.  A ‘union’ is similar to a ‘struct’, but only one declared
field is used in a particular instance at one time.  Unions are
primarily used to interface with unions in C code.  Accessing union
fields is unsafe because Rust can't guarantee the type of the data
currently being stored in the union instance.  You can learn more about
unions in the Rust Reference
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../reference/items/unions.html).


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Using Miri to check unsafe code,  Next: When to Use Unsafe Code,  Prev: Accessing Fields of a Union,  Up: Unsafe Rust

22.1.1.6 Using Miri to check unsafe code
........................................

When writing unsafe code, you might want to check that what you have
written actually is safe and correct.  One of the best ways to do that
is to use Miri (https://github.com/rust-lang/miri), an official Rust
tool for detecting undefined behavior.  Whereas the borrow checker is a
‘static’ tool which works at compile time, Miri is a ‘dynamic’ tool
which works at runtime.  It checks your code by running your program, or
its test suite, and detecting when you violate the rules it understands
about how Rust should work.

Using Miri requires a nightly build of Rust (which we talk about more in
*note Appendix G How Rust is Made and “Nightly Rust”: Appendix G - How
Rust is Made and “Nightly Rust”.).  You can install both a nightly
version of Rust and the Miri tool by typing ‘rustup +nightly component
add miri’.  This does not change what version of Rust your project uses;
it only adds the tool to your system so you can use it when you want to.
You can run Miri on a project by typing ‘cargo +nightly miri run’ or
‘cargo +nightly miri test’.

For an example of how helpful this can be, consider what happens when we
run it against Listing 20-11:

$ cargo +nightly miri run

It helpfully and correctly notices that we have shared references to
mutable data, and warns about it.  In this case, it does not tell us how
to fix the problem, but it means that we know there is a possible issue
and can think about how to make sure it is safe.  In other cases, it can
actually tell us that some code is ‘sure’ to be wrong and make
recommendations about how to fix it.

Miri doesn't catch ‘everything’ you might get wrong when writing unsafe
code.  For one thing, since it is a dynamic check, it only catches
problems with code that actually gets run.  That means you will need to
use it in conjunction with good testing techniques to increase your
confidence about the unsafe code you have written.  For another thing,
it does not cover every possible way your code can be unsound.  If Miri
‘does’ catch a problem, you know there's a bug, but just because Miri
‘doesn't’ catch a bug doesn't mean there isn't a problem.  Miri can
catch a lot, though.  Try running it on the other examples of unsafe
code in this chapter and see what it says!

22.1.1.7 When to Use Unsafe Code
................................

Using ‘unsafe’ to take one of the five actions (superpowers) just
discussed isn't wrong or even frowned upon.  But it is trickier to get
‘unsafe’ code correct because the compiler can't help uphold memory
safety.  When you have a reason to use ‘unsafe’ code, you can do so, and
having the explicit ‘unsafe’ annotation makes it easier to track down
the source of problems when they occur.  Whenever you write unsafe code,
you can use Miri to help you be more confident that the code you have
written upholds Rust's rules.

22.1.2.1 Specifying Placeholder Types in Trait Definitions with
...............................................................

Associated Types ‘Associated types’ connect a type placeholder with a
trait such that the trait method definitions can use these placeholder
types in their signatures.  The implementor of a trait will specify the
concrete type to be used instead of the placeholder type for the
particular implementation.  That way, we can define a trait that uses
some types without needing to know exactly what those types are until
the trait is implemented.

We've described most of the advanced features in this chapter as being
rarely needed.  Associated types are somewhere in the middle: they're
used more rarely than features explained in the rest of the book but
more commonly than many of the other features discussed in this chapter.

One example of a trait with an associated type is the ‘Iterator’ trait
that the standard library provides.  The associated type is named ‘Item’
and stands in for the type of the values the type implementing the
‘Iterator’ trait is iterating over.  The definition of the ‘Iterator’
trait is as shown in Listing 20-13.

pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}

The type ‘Item’ is a placeholder, and the ‘next’ method's definition
shows that it will return values of type ‘Option<Self::Item>’.
Implementors of the ‘Iterator’ trait will specify the concrete type for
‘Item’, and the ‘next’ method will return an ‘Option’ containing a value
of that concrete type.

Associated types might seem like a similar concept to generics, in that
the latter allow us to define a function without specifying what types
it can handle.  To examine the difference between the two concepts,
we'll look at an implementation of the ‘Iterator’ trait on a type named
‘Counter’ that specifies the ‘Item’ type is ‘u32’:

impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        // --snip--

This syntax seems comparable to that of generics.  So why not just
define the ‘Iterator’ trait with generics, as shown in Listing 20-14?

pub trait Iterator<T> {
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T>;
}

The difference is that when using generics, as in Listing 20-14, we must
annotate the types in each implementation; because we can also implement
‘Iterator<String> for Counter’ or any other type, we could have multiple
implementations of ‘Iterator’ for ‘Counter’.  In other words, when a
trait has a generic parameter, it can be implemented for a type multiple
times, changing the concrete types of the generic type parameters each
time.  When we use the ‘next’ method on ‘Counter’, we would have to
provide type annotations to indicate which implementation of ‘Iterator’
we want to use.

With associated types, we don't need to annotate types because we can't
implement a trait on a type multiple times.  In Listing 20-13 with the
definition that uses associated types, we can only choose what the type
of ‘Item’ will be once, because there can only be one ‘impl Iterator for
Counter’.  We don't have to specify that we want an iterator of ‘u32’
values everywhere that we call ‘next’ on ‘Counter’.

Associated types also become part of the trait's contract: implementors
of the trait must provide a type to stand in for the associated type
placeholder.  Associated types often have a name that describes how the
type will be used, and documenting the associated type in the API
documentation is good practice.

22.1.2.2 Default Generic Type Parameters and Operator Overloading
.................................................................

When we use generic type parameters, we can specify a default concrete
type for the generic type.  This eliminates the need for implementors of
the trait to specify a concrete type if the default type works.  You
specify a default type when declaring a generic type with the
‘<PlaceholderType=ConcreteType>’ syntax.

A great example of a situation where this technique is useful is with
‘operator overloading’, in which you customize the behavior of an
operator (such as ‘+’) in particular situations.

Rust doesn't allow you to create your own operators or overload
arbitrary operators.  But you can overload the operations and
corresponding traits listed in ‘std::ops’ by implementing the traits
associated with the operator.  For example, in Listing 20-15 we overload
the ‘+’ operator to add two ‘Point’ instances together.  We do this by
implementing the ‘Add’ trait on a ‘Point’ struct:

use std::ops::Add;

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;

    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {
        Point {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(
        Point { x: 1, y: 0 } + Point { x: 2, y: 3 },
        Point { x: 3, y: 3 }
    );
}

The ‘add’ method adds the ‘x’ values of two ‘Point’ instances and the
‘y’ values of two ‘Point’ instances to create a new ‘Point’.  The ‘Add’
trait has an associated type named ‘Output’ that determines the type
returned from the ‘add’ method.

The default generic type in this code is within the ‘Add’ trait.  Here
is its definition:

trait Add<Rhs=Self> {
    type Output;

    fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
}

This code should look generally familiar: a trait with one method and an
associated type.  The new part is ‘Rhs=Self’: this syntax is called
‘default type parameters’.  The ‘Rhs’ generic type parameter (short for
“right hand side”) defines the type of the ‘rhs’ parameter in the ‘add’
method.  If we don't specify a concrete type for ‘Rhs’ when we implement
the ‘Add’ trait, the type of ‘Rhs’ will default to ‘Self’, which will be
the type we're implementing ‘Add’ on.

When we implemented ‘Add’ for ‘Point’, we used the default for ‘Rhs’
because we wanted to add two ‘Point’ instances.  Let's look at an
example of implementing the ‘Add’ trait where we want to customize the
‘Rhs’ type rather than using the default.

We have two structs, ‘Millimeters’ and ‘Meters’, holding values in
different units.  This thin wrapping of an existing type in another
struct is known as the ‘newtype pattern’, which we describe in more
detail in the *note “Using the Newtype Pattern to Implement External
Traits on External Types”: Using the Newtype Pattern to Implement
External Traits on External Types. section.  We want to add values in
millimeters to values in meters and have the implementation of ‘Add’ do
the conversion correctly.  We can implement ‘Add’ for ‘Millimeters’ with
‘Meters’ as the ‘Rhs’, as shown in Listing 20-16.

use std::ops::Add;

struct Millimeters(u32);
struct Meters(u32);

impl Add<Meters> for Millimeters {
    type Output = Millimeters;

    fn add(self, other: Meters) -> Millimeters {
        Millimeters(self.0 + (other.0 * 1000))
    }
}

To add ‘Millimeters’ and ‘Meters’, we specify ‘impl Add<Meters>’ to set
the value of the ‘Rhs’ type parameter instead of using the default of
‘Self’.

You'll use default type parameters in two main ways:

   • To extend a type without breaking existing code
   • To allow customization in specific cases most users won't need

The standard library's ‘Add’ trait is an example of the second purpose:
usually, you'll add two like types, but the ‘Add’ trait provides the
ability to customize beyond that.  Using a default type parameter in the
‘Add’ trait definition means you don't have to specify the extra
parameter most of the time.  In other words, a bit of implementation
boilerplate isn't needed, making it easier to use the trait.

The first purpose is similar to the second but in reverse: if you want
to add a type parameter to an existing trait, you can give it a default
to allow extension of the functionality of the trait without breaking
the existing implementation code.

22.1.2.3 Fully Qualified Syntax for Disambiguation: Calling
...........................................................

Methods with the Same Name Nothing in Rust prevents a trait from having
a method with the same name as another trait's method, nor does Rust
prevent you from implementing both traits on one type.  It's also
possible to implement a method directly on the type with the same name
as methods from traits.

When calling methods with the same name, you'll need to tell Rust which
one you want to use.  Consider the code in Listing 20-17 where we've
defined two traits, ‘Pilot’ and ‘Wizard’, that both have a method called
‘fly’.  We then implement both traits on a type ‘Human’ that already has
a method named ‘fly’ implemented on it.  Each ‘fly’ method does
something different.

trait Pilot {
    fn fly(&self);
}

trait Wizard {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Human;

impl Pilot for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("This is your captain speaking.");
    }
}

impl Wizard for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Up!");
    }
}

impl Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("*waving arms furiously*");
    }
}

When we call ‘fly’ on an instance of ‘Human’, the compiler defaults to
calling the method that is directly implemented on the type, as shown in
Listing 20-18.

fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    person.fly();
}

Running this code will print ‘*waving arms furiously*’, showing that
Rust called the ‘fly’ method implemented on ‘Human’ directly.

To call the ‘fly’ methods from either the ‘Pilot’ trait or the ‘Wizard’
trait, we need to use more explicit syntax to specify which ‘fly’ method
we mean.  Listing 20-19 demonstrates this syntax.

fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    Pilot::fly(&person);
    Wizard::fly(&person);
    person.fly();
}

Specifying the trait name before the method name clarifies to Rust which
implementation of ‘fly’ we want to call.  We could also write
‘Human::fly(&person)’, which is equivalent to the ‘person.fly()’ that we
used in Listing 20-19, but this is a bit longer to write if we don't
need to disambiguate.

Running this code prints the following:

$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.46s
     Running `target/debug/traits-example`
This is your captain speaking.
Up!
*waving arms furiously*

Because the ‘fly’ method takes a ‘self’ parameter, if we had two ‘types’
that both implement one ‘trait’, Rust could figure out which
implementation of a trait to use based on the type of ‘self’.

However, associated functions that are not methods don't have a ‘self’
parameter.  When there are multiple types or traits that define
non-method functions with the same function name, Rust doesn't always
know which type you mean unless you use ‘fully qualified syntax’.  For
example, in Listing 20-20 we create a trait for an animal shelter that
wants to name all baby dogs ‘Spot’.  We make an ‘Animal’ trait with an
associated non-method function ‘baby_name’.  The ‘Animal’ trait is
implemented for the struct ‘Dog’, on which we also provide an associated
non-method function ‘baby_name’ directly.

trait Animal {
    fn baby_name() -> String;
}

struct Dog;

impl Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("Spot")
    }
}

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("puppy")
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", Dog::baby_name());
}

We implement the code for naming all puppies Spot in the ‘baby_name’
associated function that is defined on ‘Dog’.  The ‘Dog’ type also
implements the trait ‘Animal’, which describes characteristics that all
animals have.  Baby dogs are called puppies, and that is expressed in
the implementation of the ‘Animal’ trait on ‘Dog’ in the ‘baby_name’
function associated with the ‘Animal’ trait.

In ‘main’, we call the ‘Dog::baby_name’ function, which calls the
associated function defined on ‘Dog’ directly.  This code prints the
following:

$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.54s
     Running `target/debug/traits-example`
A baby dog is called a Spot

This output isn't what we wanted.  We want to call the ‘baby_name’
function that is part of the ‘Animal’ trait that we implemented on ‘Dog’
so the code prints ‘A baby dog is called a puppy’.  The technique of
specifying the trait name that we used in Listing 20-19 doesn't help
here; if we change ‘main’ to the code in Listing 20-21, we'll get a
compilation error.

fn main() {
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", Animal::baby_name());
}

Because ‘Animal::baby_name’ doesn't have a ‘self’ parameter, and there
could be other types that implement the ‘Animal’ trait, Rust can't
figure out which implementation of ‘Animal::baby_name’ we want.  We'll
get this compiler error:

$ cargo run

To disambiguate and tell Rust that we want to use the implementation of
‘Animal’ for ‘Dog’ as opposed to the implementation of ‘Animal’ for some
other type, we need to use fully qualified syntax.  Listing 20-22
demonstrates how to use fully qualified syntax.

fn main() {
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", <Dog as Animal>::baby_name());
}

We're providing Rust with a type annotation within the angle brackets,
which indicates we want to call the ‘baby_name’ method from the ‘Animal’
trait as implemented on ‘Dog’ by saying that we want to treat the ‘Dog’
type as an ‘Animal’ for this function call.  This code will now print
what we want:

A baby dog is called a puppy

In general, fully qualified syntax is defined as follows:

<Type as Trait>::function(receiver_if_method, next_arg, ...);

For associated functions that aren't methods, there would not be a
‘receiver’: there would only be the list of other arguments.  You could
use fully qualified syntax everywhere that you call functions or
methods.  However, you're allowed to omit any part of this syntax that
Rust can figure out from other information in the program.  You only
need to use this more verbose syntax in cases where there are multiple
implementations that use the same name and Rust needs help to identify
which implementation you want to call.

22.1.2.4 Using Supertraits to Require One Trait's Functionality
...............................................................

Within Another Trait Sometimes, you might write a trait definition that
depends on another trait: for a type to implement the first trait, you
want to require that type to also implement the second trait.  You would
do this so that your trait definition can make use of the associated
items of the second trait.  The trait your trait definition is relying
on is called a ‘supertrait’ of your trait.

For example, let's say we want to make an ‘OutlinePrint’ trait with an
‘outline_print’ method that will print a given value formatted so that
it's framed in asterisks.  That is, given a ‘Point’ struct that
implements the standard library trait ‘Display’ to result in ‘(x, y)’,
when we call ‘outline_print’ on a ‘Point’ instance that has ‘1’ for ‘x’
and ‘3’ for ‘y’, it should print the following:

**********
*        *
* (1, 3) *
*        *
**********

In the implementation of the ‘outline_print’ method, we want to use the
‘Display’ trait's functionality.  Therefore, we need to specify that the
‘OutlinePrint’ trait will work only for types that also implement
‘Display’ and provide the functionality that ‘OutlinePrint’ needs.  We
can do that in the trait definition by specifying ‘OutlinePrint:
Display’.  This technique is similar to adding a trait bound to the
trait.  Listing 20-23 shows an implementation of the ‘OutlinePrint’
trait.

use std::fmt;

trait OutlinePrint: fmt::Display {
    fn outline_print(&self) {
        let output = self.to_string();
        let len = output.len();
        println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
        println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
        println!("* {output} *");
        println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
        println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
    }
}

Because we've specified that ‘OutlinePrint’ requires the ‘Display’
trait, we can use the ‘to_string’ function that is automatically
implemented for any type that implements ‘Display’.  If we tried to use
‘to_string’ without adding a colon and specifying the ‘Display’ trait
after the trait name, we'd get an error saying that no method named
‘to_string’ was found for the type ‘&Self’ in the current scope.

Let's see what happens when we try to implement ‘OutlinePrint’ on a type
that doesn't implement ‘Display’, such as the ‘Point’ struct:

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl OutlinePrint for Point {}

We get an error saying that ‘Display’ is required but not implemented:

$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)

error: could not compile `traits-example` (bin "traits-example") due to 2 previous errors

To fix this, we implement ‘Display’ on ‘Point’ and satisfy the
constraint that ‘OutlinePrint’ requires, like so:

use std::fmt;

impl fmt::Display for Point {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

Then implementing the ‘OutlinePrint’ trait on ‘Point’ will compile
successfully, and we can call ‘outline_print’ on a ‘Point’ instance to
display it within an outline of asterisks.

22.1.2.5 Using the Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on
..................................................................

External Types In Chapter 10 in the *note “Implementing a Trait on a
Type”: Implementing a Trait on a Type. section, we mentioned the orphan
rule that states we're only allowed to implement a trait on a type if
either the trait or the type are local to our crate.  It's possible to
get around this restriction using the ‘newtype pattern’, which involves
creating a new type in a tuple struct.  (We covered tuple structs in the
*note “Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different
Types”: Using Tuple Structs Without Named Fields to Create Different
Types. section of Chapter 5.)  The tuple struct will have one field and
be a thin wrapper around the type we want to implement a trait for.
Then the wrapper type is local to our crate, and we can implement the
trait on the wrapper.  ‘Newtype’ is a term that originates from the
Haskell programming language.  There is no runtime performance penalty
for using this pattern, and the wrapper type is elided at compile time.

As an example, let's say we want to implement ‘Display’ on ‘Vec<T>’,
which the orphan rule prevents us from doing directly because the
‘Display’ trait and the ‘Vec<T>’ type are defined outside our crate.  We
can make a ‘Wrapper’ struct that holds an instance of ‘Vec<T>’; then we
can implement ‘Display’ on ‘Wrapper’ and use the ‘Vec<T>’ value, as
shown in Listing 20-24.

use std::fmt;

struct Wrapper(Vec<String>);

impl fmt::Display for Wrapper {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "[{}]", self.0.join(", "))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let w = Wrapper(vec![String::from("hello"), String::from("world")]);
    println!("w = {w}");
}

The implementation of ‘Display’ uses ‘self.0’ to access the inner
‘Vec<T>’, because ‘Wrapper’ is a tuple struct and ‘Vec<T>’ is the item
at index 0 in the tuple.  Then we can use the functionality of the
‘Display’ trait on ‘Wrapper’.

The downside of using this technique is that ‘Wrapper’ is a new type, so
it doesn't have the methods of the value it's holding.  We would have to
implement all the methods of ‘Vec<T>’ directly on ‘Wrapper’ such that
the methods delegate to ‘self.0’, which would allow us to treat
‘Wrapper’ exactly like a ‘Vec<T>’.  If we wanted the new type to have
every method the inner type has, implementing the ‘Deref’ trait
(discussed in Chapter 15 in the *note “Treating Smart Pointers Like
Regular References with the ‘Deref’ Trait”: Treating Smart Pointers Like
Regular References with the Deref Trait. section) on the ‘Wrapper’ to
return the inner type would be a solution.  If we don't want the
‘Wrapper’ type to have all the methods of the inner type--for example,
to restrict the ‘Wrapper’ type's behavior--we would have to implement
just the methods we do want manually.

This newtype pattern is also useful even when traits are not involved.
Let's switch focus and look at some advanced ways to interact with
Rust's type system.

22.1.3 Advanced Types
---------------------

The Rust type system has some features that we've so far mentioned but
haven't yet discussed.  We'll start by discussing newtypes in general as
we examine why newtypes are useful as types.  Then we'll move on to type
aliases, a feature similar to newtypes but with slightly different
semantics.  We'll also discuss the ‘!’ type and dynamically sized types.

22.1.3.1 Using the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction
..................................................................

Note: This section assumes you've read the earlier section *note “Using
the Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External Types”:
Using the Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External
Types.

The newtype pattern is also useful for tasks beyond those we've
discussed so far, including statically enforcing that values are never
confused and indicating the units of a value.  You saw an example of
using newtypes to indicate units in Listing 20-16: recall that the
‘Millimeters’ and ‘Meters’ structs wrapped ‘u32’ values in a newtype.
If we wrote a function with a parameter of type ‘Millimeters’, we
couldn't compile a program that accidentally tried to call that function
with a value of type ‘Meters’ or a plain ‘u32’.

We can also use the newtype pattern to abstract away some implementation
details of a type: the new type can expose a public API that is
different from the API of the private inner type.

Newtypes can also hide internal implementation.  For example, we could
provide a ‘People’ type to wrap a ‘HashMap<i32, String>’ that stores a
person's ID associated with their name.  Code using ‘People’ would only
interact with the public API we provide, such as a method to add a name
string to the ‘People’ collection; that code wouldn't need to know that
we assign an ‘i32’ ID to names internally.  The newtype pattern is a
lightweight way to achieve encapsulation to hide implementation details,
which we discussed in the *note “Encapsulation that Hides Implementation
Details”: Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details. section of
Chapter 18.

22.1.3.2 Creating Type Synonyms with Type Aliases
.................................................

Rust provides the ability to declare a ‘type alias’ to give an existing
type another name.  For this we use the ‘type’ keyword.  For example, we
can create the alias ‘Kilometers’ to ‘i32’ like so:

    type Kilometers = i32;

Now, the alias ‘Kilometers’ is a ‘synonym’ for ‘i32’; unlike the
‘Millimeters’ and ‘Meters’ types we created in Listing 20-16,
‘Kilometers’ is not a separate, new type.  Values that have the type
‘Kilometers’ will be treated the same as values of type ‘i32’:

    type Kilometers = i32;

    let x: i32 = 5;
    let y: Kilometers = 5;

    println!("x + y = {}", x + y);

Because ‘Kilometers’ and ‘i32’ are the same type, we can add values of
both types and we can pass ‘Kilometers’ values to functions that take
‘i32’ parameters.  However, using this method, we don't get the type
checking benefits that we get from the newtype pattern discussed
earlier.  In other words, if we mix up ‘Kilometers’ and ‘i32’ values
somewhere, the compiler will not give us an error.

The main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition.  For
example, we might have a lengthy type like this:

Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>

Writing this lengthy type in function signatures and as type annotations
all over the code can be tiresome and error prone.  Imagine having a
project full of code like that in Listing 20-25.

    let f: Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static> = Box::new(|| println!("hi"));

    fn takes_long_type(f: Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>) {
        // --snip--
    }

    fn returns_long_type() -> Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static> {
        // --snip--
    }

A type alias makes this code more manageable by reducing the repetition.
In Listing 20-26, we've introduced an alias named ‘Thunk’ for the
verbose type and can replace all uses of the type with the shorter alias
‘Thunk’.

    type Thunk = Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>;

    let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!("hi"));

    fn takes_long_type(f: Thunk) {
        // --snip--
    }

    fn returns_long_type() -> Thunk {
        // --snip--
    }

This code is much easier to read and write!  Choosing a meaningful name
for a type alias can help communicate your intent as well (‘thunk’ is a
word for code to be evaluated at a later time, so it's an appropriate
name for a closure that gets stored).

Type aliases are also commonly used with the ‘Result<T, E>’ type for
reducing repetition.  Consider the ‘std::io’ module in the standard
library.  I/O operations often return a ‘Result<T, E>’ to handle
situations when operations fail to work.  This library has a
‘std::io::Error’ struct that represents all possible I/O errors.  Many
of the functions in ‘std::io’ will be returning ‘Result<T, E>’ where the
‘E’ is ‘std::io::Error’, such as these functions in the ‘Write’ trait:

use std::fmt;
use std::io::Error;

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, Error>;
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error>;

    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Error>;
    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -> Result<(), Error>;
}

The ‘Result<..., Error>’ is repeated a lot.  As such, ‘std::io’ has this
type alias declaration:

type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, std::io::Error>;

Because this declaration is in the ‘std::io’ module, we can use the
fully qualified alias ‘std::io::Result<T>’; that is, a ‘Result<T, E>’
with the ‘E’ filled in as ‘std::io::Error’.  The ‘Write’ trait function
signatures end up looking like this:

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize>;
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<()>;

    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;
    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -> Result<()>;
}

The type alias helps in two ways: it makes code easier to write ‘and’ it
gives us a consistent interface across all of ‘std::io’.  Because it's
an alias, it's just another ‘Result<T, E>’, which means we can use any
methods that work on ‘Result<T, E>’ with it, as well as special syntax
like the ‘?’ operator.

22.1.3.3 The Never Type that Never Returns
..........................................

Rust has a special type named ‘!’ that's known in type theory lingo as
the ‘empty type’ because it has no values.  We prefer to call it the
‘never type’ because it stands in the place of the return type when a
function will never return.  Here is an example:

fn bar() -> ! {
    // --snip--
}

This code is read as “the function ‘bar’ returns never.” Functions that
return never are called ‘diverging functions’.  We can't create values
of the type ‘!’ so ‘bar’ can never possibly return.

But what use is a type you can never create values for?  Recall the code
from Listing 2-5, part of the number guessing game; we've reproduced a
bit of it here in Listing 20-27.

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

At the time, we skipped over some details in this code.  In Chapter 6 in
*note “The ‘match’ Control Flow Operator”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch06-02-matchmd__the-match-control-flow-operator.
section, we discussed that ‘match’ arms must all return the same type.
So, for example, the following code doesn't work:

    let guess = match guess.trim().parse() {
        Ok(_) => 5,
        Err(_) => "hello",
    };

The type of ‘guess’ in this code would have to be an integer ‘and’ a
string, and Rust requires that ‘guess’ have only one type.  So what does
‘continue’ return?  How were we allowed to return a ‘u32’ from one arm
and have another arm that ends with ‘continue’ in Listing 20-27?

As you might have guessed, ‘continue’ has a ‘!’ value.  That is, when
Rust computes the type of ‘guess’, it looks at both match arms, the
former with a value of ‘u32’ and the latter with a ‘!’ value.  Because
‘!’ can never have a value, Rust decides that the type of ‘guess’ is
‘u32’.

The formal way of describing this behavior is that expressions of type
‘!’ can be coerced into any other type.  We're allowed to end this
‘match’ arm with ‘continue’ because ‘continue’ doesn't return a value;
instead, it moves control back to the top of the loop, so in the ‘Err’
case, we never assign a value to ‘guess’.

The never type is useful with the ‘panic!’ macro as well.  Recall the
‘unwrap’ function that we call on ‘Option<T>’ values to produce a value
or panic with this definition:

impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn unwrap(self) -> T {
        match self {
            Some(val) => val,
            None => panic!("called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value"),
        }
    }
}

In this code, the same thing happens as in the ‘match’ in Listing 20-27:
Rust sees that ‘val’ has the type ‘T’ and ‘panic!’ has the type ‘!’, so
the result of the overall ‘match’ expression is ‘T’.  This code works
because ‘panic!’ doesn't produce a value; it ends the program.  In the
‘None’ case, we won't be returning a value from ‘unwrap’, so this code
is valid.

One final expression that has the type ‘!’ is a ‘loop’:

    print!("forever ");

    loop {
        print!("and ever ");
    }

Here, the loop never ends, so ‘!’ is the value of the expression.
However, this wouldn't be true if we included a ‘break’, because the
loop would terminate when it got to the ‘break’.

22.1.3.4 Dynamically Sized Types and the ‘Sized’ Trait
......................................................

Rust needs to know certain details about its types, such as how much
space to allocate for a value of a particular type.  This leaves one
corner of its type system a little confusing at first: the concept of
‘dynamically sized types’.  Sometimes referred to as ‘DSTs’ or ‘unsized
types’, these types let us write code using values whose size we can
know only at runtime.

Let's dig into the details of a dynamically sized type called ‘str’,
which we've been using throughout the book.  That's right, not ‘&str’,
but ‘str’ on its own, is a DST. We can't know how long the string is
until runtime, meaning we can't create a variable of type ‘str’, nor can
we take an argument of type ‘str’.  Consider the following code, which
does not work:

    let s1: str = "Hello there!";
    let s2: str = "How's it going?";

Rust needs to know how much memory to allocate for any value of a
particular type, and all values of a type must use the same amount of
memory.  If Rust allowed us to write this code, these two ‘str’ values
would need to take up the same amount of space.  But they have different
lengths: ‘s1’ needs 12 bytes of storage and ‘s2’ needs 15.  This is why
it's not possible to create a variable holding a dynamically sized type.

So what do we do?  In this case, you already know the answer: we make
the types of ‘s1’ and ‘s2’ a ‘&str’ rather than a ‘str’.  Recall from
the *note “String Slices”: String Slices. section of Chapter 4 that the
slice data structure just stores the starting position and the length of
the slice.  So although a ‘&T’ is a single value that stores the memory
address of where the ‘T’ is located, a ‘&str’ is ‘two’ values: the
address of the ‘str’ and its length.  As such, we can know the size of a
‘&str’ value at compile time: it's twice the length of a ‘usize’.  That
is, we always know the size of a ‘&str’, no matter how long the string
it refers to is.  In general, this is the way in which dynamically sized
types are used in Rust: they have an extra bit of metadata that stores
the size of the dynamic information.  The golden rule of dynamically
sized types is that we must always put values of dynamically sized types
behind a pointer of some kind.

We can combine ‘str’ with all kinds of pointers: for example, ‘Box<str>’
or ‘Rc<str>’.  In fact, you've seen this before but with a different
dynamically sized type: traits.  Every trait is a dynamically sized type
we can refer to by using the name of the trait.  In Chapter 18 in the
*note “Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types”:
Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types. section,
we mentioned that to use traits as trait objects, we must put them
behind a pointer, such as ‘&dyn Trait’ or ‘Box<dyn Trait>’ (‘Rc<dyn
Trait>’ would work too).

To work with DSTs, Rust provides the ‘Sized’ trait to determine whether
or not a type's size is known at compile time.  This trait is
automatically implemented for everything whose size is known at compile
time.  In addition, Rust implicitly adds a bound on ‘Sized’ to every
generic function.  That is, a generic function definition like this:

fn generic<T>(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}

is actually treated as though we had written this:

fn generic<T: Sized>(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}

By default, generic functions will work only on types that have a known
size at compile time.  However, you can use the following special syntax
to relax this restriction:

fn generic<T: ?Sized>(t: &T) {
    // --snip--
}

A trait bound on ‘?Sized’ means “‘T’ may or may not be ‘Sized’” and this
notation overrides the default that generic types must have a known size
at compile time.  The ‘?Trait’ syntax with this meaning is only
available for ‘Sized’, not any other traits.

Also note that we switched the type of the ‘t’ parameter from ‘T’ to
‘&T’.  Because the type might not be ‘Sized’, we need to use it behind
some kind of pointer.  In this case, we've chosen a reference.

Next, we'll talk about functions and closures!

22.1.4 Advanced Functions and Closures
--------------------------------------

This section explores some advanced features related to functions and
closures, including function pointers and returning closures.

* Menu:

* Function Pointers::
* Returning Closures::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Function Pointers,  Next: Returning Closures,  Prev: Advanced Functions and Closures,  Up: Advanced Functions and Closures

22.1.4.1 Function Pointers
..........................

We've talked about how to pass closures to functions; you can also pass
regular functions to functions!  This technique is useful when you want
to pass a function you've already defined rather than defining a new
closure.  Functions coerce to the type ‘fn’ (with a lowercase f), not to
be confused with the ‘Fn’ closure trait.  The ‘fn’ type is called a
‘function pointer’.  Passing functions with function pointers will allow
you to use functions as arguments to other functions.

The syntax for specifying that a parameter is a function pointer is
similar to that of closures, as shown in Listing 20-28, where we've
defined a function ‘add_one’ that adds one to its parameter.  The
function ‘do_twice’ takes two parameters: a function pointer to any
function that takes an ‘i32’ parameter and returns an ‘i32’, and one
‘i32’ value.  The ‘do_twice’ function calls the function ‘f’ twice,
passing it the ‘arg’ value, then adds the two function call results
together.  The ‘main’ function calls ‘do_twice’ with the arguments
‘add_one’ and ‘5’.

fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}

fn main() {
    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 5);

    println!("The answer is: {answer}");
}

This code prints ‘The answer is: 12’.  We specify that the parameter ‘f’
in ‘do_twice’ is an ‘fn’ that takes one parameter of type ‘i32’ and
returns an ‘i32’.  We can then call ‘f’ in the body of ‘do_twice’.  In
‘main’, we can pass the function name ‘add_one’ as the first argument to
‘do_twice’.

Unlike closures, ‘fn’ is a type rather than a trait, so we specify ‘fn’
as the parameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type
parameter with one of the ‘Fn’ traits as a trait bound.

Function pointers implement all three of the closure traits (‘Fn’,
‘FnMut’, and ‘FnOnce’), meaning you can always pass a function pointer
as an argument for a function that expects a closure.  It's best to
write functions using a generic type and one of the closure traits so
your functions can accept either functions or closures.

That said, one example of where you would want to only accept ‘fn’ and
not closures is when interfacing with external code that doesn't have
closures: C functions can accept functions as arguments, but C doesn't
have closures.

As an example of where you could use either a closure defined inline or
a named function, let's look at a use of the ‘map’ method provided by
the ‘Iterator’ trait in the standard library.  To use the ‘map’ function
to turn a vector of numbers into a vector of strings, we could use a
closure, like this:

    let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let list_of_strings: Vec<String> =
        list_of_numbers.iter().map(|i| i.to_string()).collect();

Or we could name a function as the argument to ‘map’ instead of the
closure, like this:

    let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let list_of_strings: Vec<String> =
        list_of_numbers.iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect();

Note that we must use the fully qualified syntax that we talked about
earlier in the *note “Advanced Traits”: Advanced Traits. section because
there are multiple functions available named ‘to_string’.  Here, we're
using the ‘to_string’ function defined in the ‘ToString’ trait, which
the standard library has implemented for any type that implements
‘Display’.

Recall from the *note “Enum values”: Enum Values. section of Chapter 6
that the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes an
initializer function.  We can use these initializer functions as
function pointers that implement the closure traits, which means we can
specify the initializer functions as arguments for methods that take
closures, like so:

    enum Status {
        Value(u32),
        Stop,
    }

    let list_of_statuses: Vec<Status> = (0u32..20).map(Status::Value).collect();

Here we create ‘Status::Value’ instances using each ‘u32’ value in the
range that ‘map’ is called on by using the initializer function of
‘Status::Value’.  Some people prefer this style, and some people prefer
to use closures.  They compile to the same code, so use whichever style
is clearer to you.

22.1.4.2 Returning Closures
...........................

Closures are represented by traits, which means you can't return
closures directly.  In most cases where you might want to return a
trait, you can instead use the concrete type that implements the trait
as the return value of the function.  However, you can't do that with
closures because they don't have a concrete type that is returnable;
you're not allowed to use the function pointer ‘fn’ as a return type,
for example.

The following code tries to return a closure directly, but it won't
compile:

fn returns_closure() -> dyn Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    |x| x + 1
}

The compiler error is as follows:

$ cargo build

  |

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0746`.
error: could not compile `functions-example` (lib) due to 1 previous error

The error references the ‘Sized’ trait again!  Rust doesn't know how
much space it will need to store the closure.  We saw a solution to this
problem earlier.  We can use a trait object:

fn returns_closure() -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    Box::new(|x| x + 1)
}

This code will compile just fine.  For more about trait objects, refer
to the section *note “Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of
Different Types”: Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different
Types. in Chapter 19.

Next, let's look at macros!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Macros,  Next: Summary 20,  Prev: Advanced Functions and Closures,  Up: Advanced Features

22.1.5 Macros
-------------

We've used macros like ‘println!’ throughout this book, but we haven't
fully explored what a macro is and how it works.  The term ‘macro’
refers to a family of features in Rust: ‘declarative’ macros with
‘macro_rules!’ and three kinds of ‘procedural’ macros:

   • Custom ‘#[derive]’ macros that specify code added with the ‘derive’
     attribute used on structs and enums
   • Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any
     item
   • Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on
     the tokens specified as their argument

We'll talk about each of these in turn, but first, let's look at why we
even need macros when we already have functions.

22.1.5.1 The Difference Between Macros and Functions
....................................................

Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code,
which is known as ‘metaprogramming’.  In Appendix C, we discuss the
‘derive’ attribute, which generates an implementation of various traits
for you.  We've also used the ‘println!’ and ‘vec!’ macros throughout
the book.  All of these macros ‘expand’ to produce more code than the
code you've written manually.

Metaprogramming is useful for reducing the amount of code you have to
write and maintain, which is also one of the roles of functions.
However, macros have some additional powers that functions don't.

A function signature must declare the number and type of parameters the
function has.  Macros, on the other hand, can take a variable number of
parameters: we can call ‘println!("hello")’ with one argument or
‘println!("hello {}", name)’ with two arguments.  Also, macros are
expanded before the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a
macro can, for example, implement a trait on a given type.  A function
can't, because it gets called at runtime and a trait needs to be
implemented at compile time.

The downside to implementing a macro instead of a function is that macro
definitions are more complex than function definitions because you're
writing Rust code that writes Rust code.  Due to this indirection, macro
definitions are generally more difficult to read, understand, and
maintain than function definitions.

Another important difference between macros and functions is that you
must define macros or bring them into scope ‘before’ you call them in a
file, as opposed to functions you can define anywhere and call anywhere.

22.1.5.2 Declarative Macros with ‘macro_rules!’ for General
...........................................................

Metaprogramming The most widely used form of macros in Rust is the
‘declarative macro’.  These are also sometimes referred to as “macros by
example,” “‘macro_rules!’ macros,” or just plain “macros.” At their
core, declarative macros allow you to write something similar to a Rust
‘match’ expression.  As discussed in Chapter 6, ‘match’ expressions are
control structures that take an expression, compare the resulting value
of the expression to patterns, and then run the code associated with the
matching pattern.  Macros also compare a value to patterns that are
associated with particular code: in this situation, the value is the
literal Rust source code passed to the macro; the patterns are compared
with the structure of that source code; and the code associated with
each pattern, when matched, replaces the code passed to the macro.  This
all happens during compilation.

To define a macro, you use the ‘macro_rules!’ construct.  Let's explore
how to use ‘macro_rules!’ by looking at how the ‘vec!’ macro is defined.
Chapter 8 covered how we can use the ‘vec!’ macro to create a new vector
with particular values.  For example, the following macro creates a new
vector containing three integers:

let v: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

We could also use the ‘vec!’ macro to make a vector of two integers or a
vector of five string slices.  We wouldn't be able to use a function to
do the same because we wouldn't know the number or type of values up
front.

Listing 20-29 shows a slightly simplified definition of the ‘vec!’
macro.

macro_rules! vec {
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) => {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}

Note: The actual definition of the ‘vec!’ macro in the standard library
includes code to preallocate the correct amount of memory up front.
That code is an optimization that we don't include here to make the
example simpler.

The ‘#[macro_export]’ annotation indicates that this macro should be
made available whenever the crate in which the macro is defined is
brought into scope.  Without this annotation, the macro can't be brought
into scope.

We then start the macro definition with ‘macro_rules!’ and the name of
the macro we're defining ‘without’ the exclamation mark.  The name, in
this case ‘vec’, is followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the
macro definition.

The structure in the ‘vec!’ body is similar to the structure of a
‘match’ expression.  Here we have one arm with the pattern ‘( $( $x:expr
),* )’, followed by ‘=>’ and the block of code associated with this
pattern.  If the pattern matches, the associated block of code will be
emitted.  Given that this is the only pattern in this macro, there is
only one valid way to match; any other pattern will result in an error.
More complex macros will have more than one arm.

Valid pattern syntax in macro definitions is different than the pattern
syntax covered in Chapter 19 because macro patterns are matched against
Rust code structure rather than values.  Let's walk through what the
pattern pieces in Listing 20-29 mean; for the full macro pattern syntax,
see the Rust Reference
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../reference/macros-by-example.html).

First, we use a set of parentheses to encompass the whole pattern.  We
use a dollar sign (‘$’) to declare a variable in the macro system that
will contain the Rust code matching the pattern.  The dollar sign makes
it clear this is a macro variable as opposed to a regular Rust variable.
Next comes a set of parentheses that captures values that match the
pattern within the parentheses for use in the replacement code.  Within
‘$()’ is ‘$x:expr’, which matches any Rust expression and gives the
expression the name ‘$x’.

The comma following ‘$()’ indicates that a literal comma separator
character could optionally appear after the code that matches the code
in ‘$()’.  The ‘*’ specifies that the pattern matches zero or more of
whatever precedes the ‘*’.

When we call this macro with ‘vec![1, 2, 3];’, the ‘$x’ pattern matches
three times with the three expressions ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’.

Now let's look at the pattern in the body of the code associated with
this arm: ‘temp_vec.push()’ within ‘$()*’ is generated for each part
that matches ‘$()’ in the pattern zero or more times depending on how
many times the pattern matches.  The ‘$x’ is replaced with each
expression matched.  When we call this macro with ‘vec![1, 2, 3];’, the
code generated that replaces this macro call will be the following:

{
    let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
    temp_vec.push(1);
    temp_vec.push(2);
    temp_vec.push(3);
    temp_vec
}

We've defined a macro that can take any number of arguments of any type
and can generate code to create a vector containing the specified
elements.

To learn more about how to write macros, consult the online
documentation or other resources, such as “The Little Book of Rust
Macros” (https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/) started by Daniel Keep and
continued by Lukas Wirth.

22.1.5.3 Procedural Macros for Generating Code from Attributes
..............................................................

The second form of macros is the ‘procedural macro’, which acts more
like a function (and is a type of procedure).  Procedural macros accept
some code as an input, operate on that code, and produce some code as an
output rather than matching against patterns and replacing the code with
other code as declarative macros do.  The three kinds of procedural
macros are custom derive, attribute-like, and function-like, and all
work in a similar fashion.

When creating procedural macros, the definitions must reside in their
own crate with a special crate type.  This is for complex technical
reasons that we hope to eliminate in the future.  In Listing 20-30, we
show how to define a procedural macro, where ‘some_attribute’ is a
placeholder for using a specific macro variety.

use proc_macro;

pub fn some_name(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
}

The function that defines a procedural macro takes a ‘TokenStream’ as an
input and produces a ‘TokenStream’ as an output.  The ‘TokenStream’ type
is defined by the ‘proc_macro’ crate that is included with Rust and
represents a sequence of tokens.  This is the core of the macro: the
source code that the macro is operating on makes up the input
‘TokenStream’, and the code the macro produces is the output
‘TokenStream’.  The function also has an attribute attached to it that
specifies which kind of procedural macro we're creating.  We can have
multiple kinds of procedural macros in the same crate.

Let's look at the different kinds of procedural macros.  We'll start
with a custom derive macro and then explain the small dissimilarities
that make the other forms different.

22.1.5.4 How to Write a Custom ‘derive’ Macro
.............................................

Let's create a crate named ‘hello_macro’ that defines a trait named
‘HelloMacro’ with one associated function named ‘hello_macro’.  Rather
than making our users implement the ‘HelloMacro’ trait for each of their
types, we'll provide a procedural macro so users can annotate their type
with ‘#[derive(HelloMacro)]’ to get a default implementation of the
‘hello_macro’ function.  The default implementation will print ‘Hello,
Macro! My name is TypeName!’ where ‘TypeName’ is the name of the type on
which this trait has been defined.  In other words, we'll write a crate
that enables another programmer to write code like Listing 20-31 using
our crate.

use hello_macro::HelloMacro;
use hello_macro_derive::HelloMacro;

struct Pancakes;

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_macro();
}

This code will print ‘Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!’ when we're
done.  The first step is to make a new library crate, like this:

$ cargo new hello_macro --lib

Next, we'll define the ‘HelloMacro’ trait and its associated function:

pub trait HelloMacro {
    fn hello_macro();
}

We have a trait and its function.  At this point, our crate user could
implement the trait to achieve the desired functionality, like so:

use hello_macro::HelloMacro;

struct Pancakes;

impl HelloMacro for Pancakes {
    fn hello_macro() {
        println!("Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_macro();
}

However, they would need to write the implementation block for each type
they wanted to use with ‘hello_macro’; we want to spare them from having
to do this work.

Additionally, we can't yet provide the ‘hello_macro’ function with
default implementation that will print the name of the type the trait is
implemented on: Rust doesn't have reflection capabilities, so it can't
look up the type's name at runtime.  We need a macro to generate code at
compile time.

The next step is to define the procedural macro.  At the time of this
writing, procedural macros need to be in their own crate.  Eventually,
this restriction might be lifted.  The convention for structuring crates
and macro crates is as follows: for a crate named ‘foo’, a custom derive
procedural macro crate is called ‘foo_derive’.  Let's start a new crate
called ‘hello_macro_derive’ inside our ‘hello_macro’ project:

$ cargo new hello_macro_derive --lib

Our two crates are tightly related, so we create the procedural macro
crate within the directory of our ‘hello_macro’ crate.  If we change the
trait definition in ‘hello_macro’, we'll have to change the
implementation of the procedural macro in ‘hello_macro_derive’ as well.
The two crates will need to be published separately, and programmers
using these crates will need to add both as dependencies and bring them
both into scope.  We could instead have the ‘hello_macro’ crate use
‘hello_macro_derive’ as a dependency and re-export the procedural macro
code.  However, the way we've structured the project makes it possible
for programmers to use ‘hello_macro’ even if they don't want the
‘derive’ functionality.

We need to declare the ‘hello_macro_derive’ crate as a procedural macro
crate.  We'll also need functionality from the ‘syn’ and ‘quote’ crates,
as you'll see in a moment, so we need to add them as dependencies.  Add
the following to the ‘Cargo.toml’ file for ‘hello_macro_derive’:

[lib]
proc-macro = true

[dependencies]
syn = "2.0"
quote = "1.0"

To start defining the procedural macro, place the code in Listing 20-32
into your ‘src/lib.rs’ file for the ‘hello_macro_derive’ crate.  Note
that this code won't compile until we add a definition for the
‘impl_hello_macro’ function.

use proc_macro::TokenStream;
use quote::quote;

pub fn hello_macro_derive(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    // Construct a representation of Rust code as a syntax tree
    // that we can manipulate
    let ast = syn::parse(input).unwrap();

    // Build the trait implementation
    impl_hello_macro(&ast)
}

Notice that we've split the code into the ‘hello_macro_derive’ function,
which is responsible for parsing the ‘TokenStream’, and the
‘impl_hello_macro’ function, which is responsible for transforming the
syntax tree: this makes writing a procedural macro more convenient.  The
code in the outer function (‘hello_macro_derive’ in this case) will be
the same for almost every procedural macro crate you see or create.  The
code you specify in the body of the inner function (‘impl_hello_macro’
in this case) will be different depending on your procedural macro's
purpose.

We've introduced three new crates: ‘proc_macro’, ‘syn’
(https://crates.io/crates/syn), and ‘quote’
(https://crates.io/crates/quote).  The ‘proc_macro’ crate comes with
Rust, so we didn't need to add that to the dependencies in ‘Cargo.toml’.
The ‘proc_macro’ crate is the compiler's API that allows us to read and
manipulate Rust code from our code.

The ‘syn’ crate parses Rust code from a string into a data structure
that we can perform operations on.  The ‘quote’ crate turns ‘syn’ data
structures back into Rust code.  These crates make it much simpler to
parse any sort of Rust code we might want to handle: writing a full
parser for Rust code is no simple task.

The ‘hello_macro_derive’ function will be called when a user of our
library specifies ‘#[derive(HelloMacro)]’ on a type.  This is possible
because we've annotated the ‘hello_macro_derive’ function here with
‘proc_macro_derive’ and specified the name ‘HelloMacro’, which matches
our trait name; this is the convention most procedural macros follow.

The ‘hello_macro_derive’ function first converts the ‘input’ from a
‘TokenStream’ to a data structure that we can then interpret and perform
operations on.  This is where ‘syn’ comes into play.  The ‘parse’
function in ‘syn’ takes a ‘TokenStream’ and returns a ‘DeriveInput’
struct representing the parsed Rust code.  Listing 20-33 shows the
relevant parts of the ‘DeriveInput’ struct we get from parsing the
‘struct Pancakes;’ string:

DeriveInput {
    // --snip--

    ident: Ident {
        ident: "Pancakes",
        span: #0 bytes(95..103)
    },
    data: Struct(
        DataStruct {
            struct_token: Struct,
            fields: Unit,
            semi_token: Some(
                Semi
            )
        }
    )
}

The fields of this struct show that the Rust code we've parsed is a unit
struct with the ‘ident’ (identifier, meaning the name) of ‘Pancakes’.
There are more fields on this struct for describing all sorts of Rust
code; check the ‘syn’ documentation for ‘DeriveInput’
(https://docs.rs/syn/2.0/syn/struct.DeriveInput.html) for more
information.

Soon we'll define the ‘impl_hello_macro’ function, which is where we'll
build the new Rust code we want to include.  But before we do, note that
the output for our derive macro is also a ‘TokenStream’.  The returned
‘TokenStream’ is added to the code that our crate users write, so when
they compile their crate, they'll get the extra functionality that we
provide in the modified ‘TokenStream’.

You might have noticed that we're calling ‘unwrap’ to cause the
‘hello_macro_derive’ function to panic if the call to the ‘syn::parse’
function fails here.  It's necessary for our procedural macro to panic
on errors because ‘proc_macro_derive’ functions must return
‘TokenStream’ rather than ‘Result’ to conform to the procedural macro
API. We've simplified this example by using ‘unwrap’; in production
code, you should provide more specific error messages about what went
wrong by using ‘panic!’ or ‘expect’.

Now that we have the code to turn the annotated Rust code from a
‘TokenStream’ into a ‘DeriveInput’ instance, let's generate the code
that implements the ‘HelloMacro’ trait on the annotated type, as shown
in Listing 20-34.

fn impl_hello_macro(ast: &syn::DeriveInput) -> TokenStream {
    let name = &ast.ident;
    let gen = quote! {
        impl HelloMacro for #name {
            fn hello_macro() {
                println!("Hello, Macro! My name is {}!", stringify!(#name));
            }
        }
    };
    gen.into()
}

We get an ‘Ident’ struct instance containing the name (identifier) of
the annotated type using ‘ast.ident’.  The struct in Listing 20-33 shows
that when we run the ‘impl_hello_macro’ function on the code in Listing
20-31, the ‘ident’ we get will have the ‘ident’ field with a value of
‘"Pancakes"’.  Thus, the ‘name’ variable in Listing 20-34 will contain
an ‘Ident’ struct instance that, when printed, will be the string
‘"Pancakes"’, the name of the struct in Listing 20-31.

The ‘quote!’ macro lets us define the Rust code that we want to return.
The compiler expects something different to the direct result of the
‘quote!’ macro's execution, so we need to convert it to a ‘TokenStream’.
We do this by calling the ‘into’ method, which consumes this
intermediate representation and returns a value of the required
‘TokenStream’ type.

The ‘quote!’ macro also provides some very cool templating mechanics: we
can enter ‘#name’, and ‘quote!’ will replace it with the value in the
variable ‘name’.  You can even do some repetition similar to the way
regular macros work.  Check out the ‘quote’ crate's docs
(https://docs.rs/quote) for a thorough introduction.

We want our procedural macro to generate an implementation of our
‘HelloMacro’ trait for the type the user annotated, which we can get by
using ‘#name’.  The trait implementation has the one function
‘hello_macro’, whose body contains the functionality we want to provide:
printing ‘Hello, Macro! My name is’ and then the name of the annotated
type.

The ‘stringify!’ macro used here is built into Rust.  It takes a Rust
expression, such as ‘1 + 2’, and at compile time turns the expression
into a string literal, such as ‘"1 + 2"’.  This is different than
‘format!’ or ‘println!’, macros which evaluate the expression and then
turn the result into a ‘String’.  There is a possibility that the
‘#name’ input might be an expression to print literally, so we use
‘stringify!’.  Using ‘stringify!’ also saves an allocation by converting
‘#name’ to a string literal at compile time.

At this point, ‘cargo build’ should complete successfully in both
‘hello_macro’ and ‘hello_macro_derive’.  Let's hook up these crates to
the code in Listing 20-31 to see the procedural macro in action!  Create
a new binary project in your ‘projects’ directory using ‘cargo new
pancakes’.  We need to add ‘hello_macro’ and ‘hello_macro_derive’ as
dependencies in the ‘pancakes’ crate's ‘Cargo.toml’.  If you're
publishing your versions of ‘hello_macro’ and ‘hello_macro_derive’ to
cratesio (https://crates.io/), they would be regular dependencies; if
not, you can specify them as ‘path’ dependencies as follows:

hello_macro = { path = "../hello_macro" }
hello_macro_derive = { path = "../hello_macro/hello_macro_derive" }

Put the code in Listing 20-31 into ‘src/main.rs’, and run ‘cargo run’:
it should print ‘Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!’ The implementation
of the ‘HelloMacro’ trait from the procedural macro was included without
the ‘pancakes’ crate needing to implement it; the
‘#[derive(HelloMacro)]’ added the trait implementation.

Next, let's explore how the other kinds of procedural macros differ from
custom derive macros.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Attribute-like macros,  Next: Function-like macros,  Prev: How to Write a Custom derive Macro,  Up: Macros

22.1.5.5 Attribute-like macros
..............................

Attribute-like macros are similar to custom derive macros, but instead
of generating code for the ‘derive’ attribute, they allow you to create
new attributes.  They're also more flexible: ‘derive’ only works for
structs and enums; attributes can be applied to other items as well,
such as functions.  Here's an example of using an attribute-like macro:
say you have an attribute named ‘route’ that annotates functions when
using a web application framework:

fn index() {

This ‘#[route]’ attribute would be defined by the framework as a
procedural macro.  The signature of the macro definition function would
look like this:

pub fn route(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {

Here, we have two parameters of type ‘TokenStream’.  The first is for
the contents of the attribute: the ‘GET, "/"’ part.  The second is the
body of the item the attribute is attached to: in this case, ‘fn index()
{}’ and the rest of the function's body.

Other than that, attribute-like macros work the same way as custom
derive macros: you create a crate with the ‘proc-macro’ crate type and
implement a function that generates the code you want!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Function-like macros,  Next: Summary 20,  Prev: Attribute-like macros,  Up: Macros

22.1.5.6 Function-like macros
.............................

Function-like macros define macros that look like function calls.
Similarly to ‘macro_rules!’ macros, they're more flexible than
functions; for example, they can take an unknown number of arguments.
However, ‘macro_rules!’ macros can be defined only using the match-like
syntax we discussed in the section *note “Declarative Macros with
‘macro_rules!’ for General Metaprogramming”: Declarative Macros with
macro_rules! for General Metaprogramming. earlier.  Function-like macros
take a ‘TokenStream’ parameter and their definition manipulates that
‘TokenStream’ using Rust code as the other two types of procedural
macros do.  An example of a function-like macro is an ‘sql!’ macro that
might be called like so:

let sql = sql!(SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1);

This macro would parse the SQL statement inside it and check that it's
syntactically correct, which is much more complex processing than a
‘macro_rules!’ macro can do.  The ‘sql!’ macro would be defined like
this:

pub fn sql(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {

This definition is similar to the custom derive macro's signature: we
receive the tokens that are inside the parentheses and return the code
we wanted to generate.

22.1.6 Summary
--------------

Whew!  Now you have some Rust features in your toolbox that you likely
won't use often, but you'll know they're available in very particular
circumstances.  We've introduced several complex topics so that when you
encounter them in error message suggestions or in other peoples' code,
you'll be able to recognize these concepts and syntax.  Use this chapter
as a reference to guide you to solutions.

Next, we'll put everything we've discussed throughout the book into
practice and do one more project!

23 Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server
*****************************************************

It's been a long journey, but we've reached the end of the book.  In
this chapter, we'll build one more project together to demonstrate some
of the concepts we covered in the final chapters, as well as recap some
earlier lessons.

For our final project, we'll make a web server that says “hello” and
looks like Figure 20-1 in a web browser.

[hello from rust]

Figure 20-1: Our final shared project

Here is our plan for building the web server:

  1. Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.
  2. Listen for TCP connections on a socket.
  3. Parse a small number of HTTP requests.
  4. Create a proper HTTP response.
  5. Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.

Before we get started, we should mention two details: First, the method
we'll use won't be the best way to build a web server with Rust.
Community members have published a number of production-ready crates
available on cratesio (https://crates.io/) that provide more complete
web server and thread pool implementations than we'll build.  However,
our intention in this chapter is to help you learn, not to take the easy
route.  Because Rust is a systems programming language, we can choose
the level of abstraction we want to work with and can go to a lower
level than is possible or practical in other languages.

Second, we will not be using async and await here.  Building a thread
pool is a big enough challenge on its own, without adding in building an
async runtime!  However, we will note how async and await might be
applicable to some of the same problems we will see in this chapter.
Ultimately, as we noted back in Chapter 17, many async runtimes use
thread pools for managing their work.

We'll therefore write the basic HTTP server and thread pool manually so
you can learn the general ideas and techniques behind the crates you
might use in the future.

23.1 Building a Single-Threaded Web Server
==========================================

We'll start by getting a single-threaded web server working.  Before we
begin, let's look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in
building web servers.  The details of these protocols are beyond the
scope of this book, but a brief overview will give you the information
you need.

The two main protocols involved in web servers are ‘Hypertext Transfer
Protocol’ ‘(HTTP)’ and ‘Transmission Control Protocol’ ‘(TCP)’.  Both
protocols are ‘request-response’ protocols, meaning a ‘client’ initiates
requests and a ‘server’ listens to the requests and provides a response
to the client.  The contents of those requests and responses are defined
by the protocols.

TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how
information gets from one server to another but doesn't specify what
that information is.  HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents
of the requests and responses.  It's technically possible to use HTTP
with other protocols, but in the vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its
data over TCP. We'll work with the raw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests
and responses.

File: RustBook.info,  Node: Listening to the TCP Connection,  Next: Reading the Request,  Prev: Building a Single-Threaded Web Server,  Up: Building a Single-Threaded Web Server

23.1.1 Listening to the TCP Connection
--------------------------------------

Our web server needs to listen to a TCP connection, so that's the first
part we'll work on.  The standard library offers a ‘std::net’ module
that lets us do this.  Let's make a new project in the usual fashion:

$ cargo new hello
     Created binary (application) `hello` project
$ cd hello

Now enter the code in Listing 21-1 in ‘src/main.rs’ to start.  This code
will listen at the local address ‘127.0.0.1:7878’ for incoming TCP
streams.  When it gets an incoming stream, it will print ‘Connection
established!’.

use std::net::TcpListener;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        println!("Connection established!");
    }
}

Using ‘TcpListener’, we can listen for TCP connections at the address
‘127.0.0.1:7878’.  In the address, the section before the colon is an IP
address representing your computer (this is the same on every computer
and doesn't represent the authors' computer specifically), and ‘7878’ is
the port.  We've chosen this port for two reasons: HTTP isn't normally
accepted on this port so our server is unlikely to conflict with any
other web server you might have running on your machine, and 7878 is
‘rust’ typed on a telephone.

The ‘bind’ function in this scenario works like the ‘new’ function in
that it will return a new ‘TcpListener’ instance.  The function is
called ‘bind’ because, in networking, connecting to a port to listen to
is known as “binding to a port.”

The ‘bind’ function returns a ‘Result<T, E>’, which indicates that it's
possible for binding to fail.  For example, connecting to port 80
requires administrator privileges (nonadministrators can listen only on
ports higher than 1023), so if we tried to connect to port 80 without
being an administrator, binding wouldn't work.  Binding also wouldn't
work, for example, if we ran two instances of our program and so had two
programs listening to the same port.  Because we're writing a basic
server just for learning purposes, we won't worry about handling these
kinds of errors; instead, we use ‘unwrap’ to stop the program if errors
happen.

The ‘incoming’ method on ‘TcpListener’ returns an iterator that gives us
a sequence of streams (more specifically, streams of type ‘TcpStream’).
A single ‘stream’ represents an open connection between the client and
the server.  A ‘connection’ is the name for the full request and
response process in which a client connects to the server, the server
generates a response, and the server closes the connection.  As such, we
will read from the ‘TcpStream’ to see what the client sent and then
write our response to the stream to send data back to the client.
Overall, this ‘for’ loop will process each connection in turn and
produce a series of streams for us to handle.

For now, our handling of the stream consists of calling ‘unwrap’ to
terminate our program if the stream has any errors; if there aren't any
errors, the program prints a message.  We'll add more functionality for
the success case in the next listing.  The reason we might receive
errors from the ‘incoming’ method when a client connects to the server
is that we're not actually iterating over connections.  Instead, we're
iterating over ‘connection attempts’.  The connection might not be
successful for a number of reasons, many of them operating system
specific.  For example, many operating systems have a limit to the
number of simultaneous open connections they can support; new connection
attempts beyond that number will produce an error until some of the open
connections are closed.

Let's try running this code!  Invoke ‘cargo run’ in the terminal and
then load ‘127.0.0.1:7878’ in a web browser.  The browser should show an
error message like “Connection reset,” because the server isn't
currently sending back any data.  But when you look at your terminal,
you should see several messages that were printed when the browser
connected to the server!

     Running `target/debug/hello`
Connection established!
Connection established!
Connection established!

Sometimes, you'll see multiple messages printed for one browser request;
the reason might be that the browser is making a request for the page as
well as a request for other resources, like the ‘favicon.ico’ icon that
appears in the browser tab.

It could also be that the browser is trying to connect to the server
multiple times because the server isn't responding with any data.  When
‘stream’ goes out of scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the
connection is closed as part of the ‘drop’ implementation.  Browsers
sometimes deal with closed connections by retrying, because the problem
might be temporary.  The important factor is that we've successfully
gotten a handle to a TCP connection!

Remember to stop the program by pressing ctrl-c when you're done running
a particular version of the code.  Then restart the program by invoking
the ‘cargo run’ command after you've made each set of code changes to
make sure you're running the newest code.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Reading the Request,  Next: A Closer Look at an HTTP Request,  Prev: Listening to the TCP Connection,  Up: Building a Single-Threaded Web Server

23.1.1.1 Reading the Request
............................

Let's implement the functionality to read the request from the browser!
To separate the concerns of first getting a connection and then taking
some action with the connection, we'll start a new function for
processing connections.  In this new ‘handle_connection’ function, we'll
read data from the TCP stream and print it so we can see the data being
sent from the browser.  Change the code to look like Listing 21-2.

use std::{
    io::{prelude::*, BufReader},
    net::{TcpListener, TcpStream},
};

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        handle_connection(stream);
    }
}

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
    let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
        .lines()
        .map(|result| result.unwrap())
        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .collect();

    println!("Request: {http_request:#?}");
}

We bring ‘std::io::prelude’ and ‘std::io::BufReader’ into scope to get
access to traits and types that let us read from and write to the
stream.  In the ‘for’ loop in the ‘main’ function, instead of printing a
message that says we made a connection, we now call the new
‘handle_connection’ function and pass the ‘stream’ to it.

In the ‘handle_connection’ function, we create a new ‘BufReader’
instance that wraps a reference to the ‘stream’.  The ‘BufReader’ adds
buffering by managing calls to the ‘std::io::Read’ trait methods for us.

We create a variable named ‘http_request’ to collect the lines of the
request the browser sends to our server.  We indicate that we want to
collect these lines in a vector by adding the ‘Vec<_>’ type annotation.

‘BufReader’ implements the ‘std::io::BufRead’ trait, which provides the
‘lines’ method.  The ‘lines’ method returns an iterator of
‘Result<String, std::io::Error>’ by splitting the stream of data
whenever it sees a newline byte.  To get each ‘String’, we map and
‘unwrap’ each ‘Result’.  The ‘Result’ might be an error if the data
isn't valid UTF-8 or if there was a problem reading from the stream.
Again, a production program should handle these errors more gracefully,
but we're choosing to stop the program in the error case for simplicity.

The browser signals the end of an HTTP request by sending two newline
characters in a row, so to get one request from the stream, we take
lines until we get a line that is the empty string.  Once we've
collected the lines into the vector, we're printing them out using
pretty debug formatting so we can take a look at the instructions the
web browser is sending to our server.

Let's try this code!  Start the program and make a request in a web
browser again.  Note that we'll still get an error page in the browser,
but our program's output in the terminal will now look similar to this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
     Running `target/debug/hello`
Request: [
    "GET / HTTP/1.1",
    "Host: 127.0.0.1:7878",
    "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:99.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/99.0",
    "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8",
    "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5",
    "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br",
    "DNT: 1",
    "Connection: keep-alive",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1",
    "Sec-Fetch-Dest: document",
    "Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate",
    "Sec-Fetch-Site: none",
    "Sec-Fetch-User: ?1",
    "Cache-Control: max-age=0",
]

Depending on your browser, you might get slightly different output.  Now
that we're printing the request data, we can see why we get multiple
connections from one browser request by looking at the path after ‘GET’
in the first line of the request.  If the repeated connections are all
requesting ‘/’, we know the browser is trying to fetch ‘/’ repeatedly
because it's not getting a response from our program.

Let's break down this request data to understand what the browser is
asking of our program.

23.1.1.2 A Closer Look at an HTTP Request
.........................................

HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:

Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body

The first line is the ‘request line’ that holds information about what
the client is requesting.  The first part of the request line indicates
the ‘method’ being used, such as ‘GET’ or ‘POST’, which describes how
the client is making this request.  Our client used a ‘GET’ request,
which means it is asking for information.

The next part of the request line is ‘/’, which indicates the ‘Uniform
Resource Identifier’ ‘(URI)’ the client is requesting: a URI is almost,
but not quite, the same as a ‘Uniform Resource Locator’ ‘(URL)’.  The
difference between URIs and URLs isn't important for our purposes in
this chapter, but the HTTP spec uses the term URI, so we can just
mentally substitute URL for URI here.

The last part is the HTTP version the client uses, and then the request
line ends in a ‘CRLF sequence’.  (CRLF stands for ‘carriage return’ and
‘line feed’, which are terms from the typewriter days!)  The CRLF
sequence can also be written as ‘\r\n’, where ‘\r’ is a carriage return
and ‘\n’ is a line feed.  The CRLF sequence separates the request line
from the rest of the request data.  Note that when the CRLF is printed,
we see a new line start rather than ‘\r\n’.

Looking at the request line data we received from running our program so
far, we see that ‘GET’ is the method, ‘/’ is the request URI, and
‘HTTP/1.1’ is the version.

After the request line, the remaining lines starting from ‘Host:’ onward
are headers.  ‘GET’ requests have no body.

Try making a request from a different browser or asking for a different
address, such as ‘127.0.0.1:7878/test’, to see how the request data
changes.

Now that we know what the browser is asking for, let's send back some
data!

23.1.1.3 Writing a Response
...........................

We're going to implement sending data in response to a client request.
Responses have the following format:

HTTP-Version Status-Code Reason-Phrase CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body

The first line is a ‘status line’ that contains the HTTP version used in
the response, a numeric status code that summarizes the result of the
request, and a reason phrase that provides a text description of the
status code.  After the CRLF sequence are any headers, another CRLF
sequence, and the body of the response.

Here is an example response that uses HTTP version 1.1, has a status
code of 200, an OK reason phrase, no headers, and no body:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n

The status code 200 is the standard success response.  The text is a
tiny successful HTTP response.  Let's write this to the stream as our
response to a successful request!  From the ‘handle_connection’
function, remove the ‘println!’ that was printing the request data and
replace it with the code in Listing 21-3.

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
    let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
        .lines()
        .map(|result| result.unwrap())
        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .collect();

    let response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n";

    stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
}

The first new line defines the ‘response’ variable that holds the
success message's data.  Then we call ‘as_bytes’ on our ‘response’ to
convert the string data to bytes.  The ‘write_all’ method on ‘stream’
takes a ‘&[u8]’ and sends those bytes directly down the connection.
Because the ‘write_all’ operation could fail, we use ‘unwrap’ on any
error result as before.  Again, in a real application you would add
error handling here.

With these changes, let's run our code and make a request.  We're no
longer printing any data to the terminal, so we won't see any output
other than the output from Cargo.  When you load ‘127.0.0.1:7878’ in a
web browser, you should get a blank page instead of an error.  You've
just hand-coded receiving an HTTP request and sending a response!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Returning Real HTML,  Next: Validating the Request and Selectively Responding,  Prev: Writing a Response,  Up: Building a Single-Threaded Web Server

23.1.1.4 Returning Real HTML
............................

Let's implement the functionality for returning more than a blank page.
Create the new file ‘hello.html’ in the root of your project directory,
not in the ‘src’ directory.  You can input any HTML you want; Listing
21-4 shows one possibility.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Hi from Rust</p>
  </body>
</html>

This is a minimal HTML5 document with a heading and some text.  To
return this from the server when a request is received, we'll modify
‘handle_connection’ as shown in Listing 21-5 to read the HTML file, add
it to the response as a body, and send it.

use std::{
    fs,
    io::{prelude::*, BufReader},
    net::{TcpListener, TcpStream},
};
// --snip--

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
    let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
        .lines()
        .map(|result| result.unwrap())
        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .collect();

    let status_line = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
    let contents = fs::read_to_string("hello.html").unwrap();
    let length = contents.len();

    let response =
        format!("{status_line}\r\nContent-Length: {length}\r\n\r\n{contents}");

    stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
}

We've added ‘fs’ to the ‘use’ statement to bring the standard library's
filesystem module into scope.  The code for reading the contents of a
file to a string should look familiar; we used it in Chapter 12 when we
read the contents of a file for our I/O project in Listing 12-4.

Next, we use ‘format!’ to add the file's contents as the body of the
success response.  To ensure a valid HTTP response, we add the
‘Content-Length’ header which is set to the size of our response body,
in this case the size of ‘hello.html’.

Run this code with ‘cargo run’ and load ‘127.0.0.1:7878’ in your
browser; you should see your HTML rendered!

Currently, we're ignoring the request data in ‘http_request’ and just
sending back the contents of the HTML file unconditionally.  That means
if you try requesting ‘127.0.0.1:7878/something-else’ in your browser,
you'll still get back this same HTML response.  At the moment, our
server is very limited and does not do what most web servers do.  We
want to customize our responses depending on the request and only send
back the HTML file for a well-formed request to ‘/’.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Validating the Request and Selectively Responding,  Next: A Touch of Refactoring,  Prev: Returning Real HTML,  Up: Building a Single-Threaded Web Server

23.1.1.5 Validating the Request and Selectively Responding
..........................................................

Right now, our web server will return the HTML in the file no matter
what the client requested.  Let's add functionality to check that the
browser is requesting ‘/’ before returning the HTML file and return an
error if the browser requests anything else.  For this we need to modify
‘handle_connection’, as shown in Listing 21-6.  This new code checks the
content of the request received against what we know a request for ‘/’
looks like and adds ‘if’ and ‘else’ blocks to treat requests
differently.

// --snip--

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
    let request_line = buf_reader.lines().next().unwrap().unwrap();

    if request_line == "GET / HTTP/1.1" {
        let status_line = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
        let contents = fs::read_to_string("hello.html").unwrap();
        let length = contents.len();

        let response = format!(
            "{status_line}\r\nContent-Length: {length}\r\n\r\n{contents}"
        );

        stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    } else {
        // some other request
    }
}

We're only going to be looking at the first line of the HTTP request, so
rather than reading the entire request into a vector, we're calling
‘next’ to get the first item from the iterator.  The first ‘unwrap’
takes care of the ‘Option’ and stops the program if the iterator has no
items.  The second ‘unwrap’ handles the ‘Result’ and has the same effect
as the ‘unwrap’ that was in the ‘map’ added in Listing 21-2.

Next, we check the ‘request_line’ to see if it equals the request line
of a GET request to the ‘/’ path.  If it does, the ‘if’ block returns
the contents of our HTML file.

If the ‘request_line’ does ‘not’ equal the GET request to the ‘/’ path,
it means we've received some other request.  We'll add code to the
‘else’ block in a moment to respond to all other requests.

Run this code now and request ‘127.0.0.1:7878’; you should get the HTML
in ‘hello.html’.  If you make any other request, such as
‘127.0.0.1:7878/something-else’, you'll get a connection error like
those you saw when running the code in Listing 21-1 and Listing 21-2.

Now let's add the code in Listing 21-7 to the ‘else’ block to return a
response with the status code 404, which signals that the content for
the request was not found.  We'll also return some HTML for a page to
render in the browser indicating the response to the end user.

    // --snip--
    } else {
        let status_line = "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND";
        let contents = fs::read_to_string("404.html").unwrap();
        let length = contents.len();

        let response = format!(
            "{status_line}\r\nContent-Length: {length}\r\n\r\n{contents}"
        );

        stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    }

Here, our response has a status line with status code 404 and the reason
phrase ‘NOT FOUND’.  The body of the response will be the HTML in the
file ‘404.html’.  You'll need to create a ‘404.html’ file next to
‘hello.html’ for the error page; again feel free to use any HTML you
want or use the example HTML in Listing 21-8.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Oops!</h1>
    <p>Sorry, I don't know what you're asking for.</p>
  </body>
</html>

With these changes, run your server again.  Requesting ‘127.0.0.1:7878’
should return the contents of ‘hello.html’, and any other request, like
‘127.0.0.1:7878/foo’, should return the error HTML from ‘404.html’.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: A Touch of Refactoring,  Next: Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server,  Prev: Validating the Request and Selectively Responding,  Up: Building a Single-Threaded Web Server

23.1.1.6 A Touch of Refactoring
...............................

At the moment the ‘if’ and ‘else’ blocks have a lot of repetition:
they're both reading files and writing the contents of the files to the
stream.  The only differences are the status line and the filename.
Let's make the code more concise by pulling out those differences into
separate ‘if’ and ‘else’ lines that will assign the values of the status
line and the filename to variables; we can then use those variables
unconditionally in the code to read the file and write the response.
Listing 21-9 shows the resulting code after replacing the large ‘if’ and
‘else’ blocks.

// --snip--

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    // --snip--

    let (status_line, filename) = if request_line == "GET / HTTP/1.1" {
        ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", "hello.html")
    } else {
        ("HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND", "404.html")
    };

    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();
    let length = contents.len();

    let response =
        format!("{status_line}\r\nContent-Length: {length}\r\n\r\n{contents}");

    stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
}

Now the ‘if’ and ‘else’ blocks only return the appropriate values for
the status line and filename in a tuple; we then use destructuring to
assign these two values to ‘status_line’ and ‘filename’ using a pattern
in the ‘let’ statement, as discussed in Chapter 19.

The previously duplicated code is now outside the ‘if’ and ‘else’ blocks
and uses the ‘status_line’ and ‘filename’ variables.  This makes it
easier to see the difference between the two cases, and it means we have
only one place to update the code if we want to change how the file
reading and response writing work.  The behavior of the code in Listing
21-9 will be the same as that in Listing 21-7.

Awesome!  We now have a simple web server in approximately 40 lines of
Rust code that responds to one request with a page of content and
responds to all other requests with a 404 response.

Currently, our server runs in a single thread, meaning it can only serve
one request at a time.  Let's examine how that can be a problem by
simulating some slow requests.  Then we'll fix it so our server can
handle multiple requests at once.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server,  Next: Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup,  Prev: Building a Single-Threaded Web Server,  Up: Final Project Building a Multithreaded Web Server

23.1.2 Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded
--------------------------------------------------------------

Server Right now, the server will process each request in turn, meaning
it won't process a second connection until the first is finished
processing.  If the server received more and more requests, this serial
execution would be less and less optimal.  If the server receives a
request that takes a long time to process, subsequent requests will have
to wait until the long request is finished, even if the new requests can
be processed quickly.  We'll need to fix this, but first, we'll look at
the problem in action.

* Menu:

* Simulating a Slow Request in the Current Server Implementation::
* Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool::


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Simulating a Slow Request in the Current Server Implementation,  Next: Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool,  Prev: Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server,  Up: Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server

23.1.2.1 Simulating a Slow Request in the Current Server
........................................................

Implementation We'll look at how a slow-processing request can affect
other requests made to our current server implementation.  Listing 21-10
implements handling a request to ‘/sleep’ with a simulated slow response
that will cause the server to sleep for 5 seconds before responding.

use std::{
    fs,
    io::{prelude::*, BufReader},
    net::{TcpListener, TcpStream},
    thread,
    time::Duration,
};
// --snip--

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    // --snip--

    let (status_line, filename) = match &request_line[..] {
        "GET / HTTP/1.1" => ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", "hello.html"),
        "GET /sleep HTTP/1.1" => {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));
            ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", "hello.html")
        }
        _ => ("HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND", "404.html"),
    };

    // --snip--
}

We switched from ‘if’ to ‘match’ now that we have three cases.  We need
to explicitly match on a slice of ‘request_line’ to pattern match
against the string literal values; ‘match’ doesn't do automatic
referencing and dereferencing like the equality method does.

The first arm is the same as the ‘if’ block from Listing 21-9.  The
second arm matches a request to ‘/sleep’.  When that request is
received, the server will sleep for 5 seconds before rendering the
successful HTML page.  The third arm is the same as the ‘else’ block
from Listing 21-9.

You can see how primitive our server is: real libraries would handle the
recognition of multiple requests in a much less verbose way!

Start the server using ‘cargo run’.  Then open two browser windows: one
for ‘http://127.0.0.1:7878/’ and the other for
‘http://127.0.0.1:7878/sleep’.  If you enter the ‘/’ URI a few times, as
before, you'll see it respond quickly.  But if you enter ‘/sleep’ and
then load ‘/’, you'll see that ‘/’ waits until ‘sleep’ has slept for its
full 5 seconds before loading.

There are multiple techniques we could use to avoid requests backing up
behind a slow request, including using async as we did Chapter 17; the
one we'll implement is a thread pool.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool,  Next: Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup,  Prev: Simulating a Slow Request in the Current Server Implementation,  Up: Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server

23.1.2.2 Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool
................................................

A ‘thread pool’ is a group of spawned threads that are waiting and ready
to handle a task.  When the program receives a new task, it assigns one
of the threads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the
task.  The remaining threads in the pool are available to handle any
other tasks that come in while the first thread is processing.  When the
first thread is done processing its task, it's returned to the pool of
idle threads, ready to handle a new task.  A thread pool allows you to
process connections concurrently, increasing the throughput of your
server.

We'll limit the number of threads in the pool to a small number to
protect us from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks; if we had our program
create a new thread for each request as it came in, someone making 10
million requests to our server could create havoc by using up all our
server's resources and grinding the processing of requests to a halt.

Rather than spawning unlimited threads, then, we'll have a fixed number
of threads waiting in the pool.  Requests that come in are sent to the
pool for processing.  The pool will maintain a queue of incoming
requests.  Each of the threads in the pool will pop off a request from
this queue, handle the request, and then ask the queue for another
request.  With this design, we can process up to ‘N’ requests
concurrently, where ‘N’ is the number of threads.  If each thread is
responding to a long-running request, subsequent requests can still back
up in the queue, but we've increased the number of long-running requests
we can handle before reaching that point.

This technique is just one of many ways to improve the throughput of a
web server.  Other options you might explore are the ‘fork/join model’,
the ‘single-threaded async I/O model’, or the ‘multi-threaded async I/O
model’.  If you're interested in this topic, you can read more about
other solutions and try to implement them; with a low-level language
like Rust, all of these options are possible.

Before we begin implementing a thread pool, let's talk about what using
the pool should look like.  When you're trying to design code, writing
the client interface first can help guide your design.  Write the API of
the code so it's structured in the way you want to call it; then
implement the functionality within that structure rather than
implementing the functionality and then designing the public API.

Similar to how we used test-driven development in the project in Chapter
12, we'll use compiler-driven development here.  We'll write the code
that calls the functions we want, and then we'll look at errors from the
compiler to determine what we should change next to get the code to
work.  Before we do that, however, we'll explore the technique we're not
going to use as a starting point.  Spawning a Thread for Each Request
First, let's explore how our code might look if it did create a new
thread for every connection.  As mentioned earlier, this isn't our final
plan due to the problems with potentially spawning an unlimited number
of threads, but it is a starting point to get a working multithreaded
server first.  Then we'll add the thread pool as an improvement, and
contrasting the two solutions will be easier.  Listing 21-11 shows the
changes to make to ‘main’ to spawn a new thread to handle each stream
within the ‘for’ loop.

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        thread::spawn(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }
}

As you learned in Chapter 16, ‘thread::spawn’ will create a new thread
and then run the code in the closure in the new thread.  If you run this
code and load ‘/sleep’ in your browser, then ‘/’ in two more browser
tabs, you'll indeed see that the requests to ‘/’ don't have to wait for
‘/sleep’ to finish.  However, as we mentioned, this will eventually
overwhelm the system because you'd be making new threads without any
limit.

You may also recall from Chapter 17 that this is exactly the kind of
situation where async and await really shine!  Keep that in mind as we
build the thread pool and think about how things would look different or
the same with async.  Creating a Finite Number of Threads We want our
thread pool to work in a similar, familiar way so switching from threads
to a thread pool doesn't require large changes to the code that uses our
API. Listing 21-12 shows the hypothetical interface for a ‘ThreadPool’
struct we want to use instead of ‘thread::spawn’.

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();
    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        pool.execute(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }
}

We use ‘ThreadPool::new’ to create a new thread pool with a configurable
number of threads, in this case four.  Then, in the ‘for’ loop,
‘pool.execute’ has a similar interface as ‘thread::spawn’ in that it
takes a closure the pool should run for each stream.  We need to
implement ‘pool.execute’ so it takes the closure and gives it to a
thread in the pool to run.  This code won't yet compile, but we'll try
so the compiler can guide us in how to fix it.  Building ‘ThreadPool’
Using Compiler Driven Development Make the changes in Listing 21-12 to
‘src/main.rs’, and then let's use the compiler errors from ‘cargo check’
to drive our development.  Here is the first error we get:

$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared type `ThreadPool`
  --> src/main.rs:11:16
   |
11 |     let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);
   |                ^^^^^^^^^^ use of undeclared type `ThreadPool`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0433`.
error: could not compile `hello` (bin "hello") due to 1 previous error

Great!  This error tells us we need a ‘ThreadPool’ type or module, so
we'll build one now.  Our ‘ThreadPool’ implementation will be
independent of the kind of work our web server is doing.  So, let's
switch the ‘hello’ crate from a binary crate to a library crate to hold
our ‘ThreadPool’ implementation.  After we change to a library crate, we
could also use the separate thread pool library for any work we want to
do using a thread pool, not just for serving web requests.

Create a ‘src/lib.rs’ that contains the following, which is the simplest
definition of a ‘ThreadPool’ struct that we can have for now:

pub struct ThreadPool;

Then edit ‘main.rs’ file to bring ‘ThreadPool’ into scope from the
library crate by adding the following code to the top of ‘src/main.rs’:

use hello::ThreadPool;

This code still won't work, but let's check it again to get the next
error that we need to address:

$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
error[E0599]: no function or associated item named `new` found for struct `ThreadPool` in the current scope
  --> src/main.rs:12:28
   |
12 |     let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);
   |                            ^^^ function or associated item not found in `ThreadPool`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0599`.
error: could not compile `hello` (bin "hello") due to 1 previous error

This error indicates that next we need to create an associated function
named ‘new’ for ‘ThreadPool’.  We also know that ‘new’ needs to have one
parameter that can accept ‘4’ as an argument and should return a
‘ThreadPool’ instance.  Let's implement the simplest ‘new’ function that
will have those characteristics:

pub struct ThreadPool;

impl ThreadPool {
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        ThreadPool
    }
}

We chose ‘usize’ as the type of the ‘size’ parameter, because we know
that a negative number of threads doesn't make any sense.  We also know
we'll use this 4 as the number of elements in a collection of threads,
which is what the ‘usize’ type is for, as discussed in the *note
“Integer Types”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch03-02-data-typesmd__integer-types. section
of Chapter 3.

Let's check the code again:

$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
error[E0599]: no method named `execute` found for struct `ThreadPool` in the current scope
  --> src/main.rs:17:14
   |
17 |         pool.execute(|| {
   |         -----^^^^^^^ method not found in `ThreadPool`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0599`.
error: could not compile `hello` (bin "hello") due to 1 previous error

Now the error occurs because we don't have an ‘execute’ method on
‘ThreadPool’.  Recall from the *note “Creating a Finite Number of
Threads”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch21-02-multithreadedmd__creating-a-finite-number-of-threads.
section that we decided our thread pool should have an interface similar
to ‘thread::spawn’.  In addition, we'll implement the ‘execute’ function
so it takes the closure it's given and gives it to an idle thread in the
pool to run.

We'll define the ‘execute’ method on ‘ThreadPool’ to take a closure as a
parameter.  Recall from the *note “Moving Captured Values Out of the
Closure and the ‘Fn’ Traits”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch13-01-closuresmd__moving-captured-values-out-of-the-closure-and-the-fn-traits.
section in Chapter 13 that we can take closures as parameters with three
different traits: ‘Fn’, ‘FnMut’, and ‘FnOnce’.  We need to decide which
kind of closure to use here.  We know we'll end up doing something
similar to the standard library ‘thread::spawn’ implementation, so we
can look at what bounds the signature of ‘thread::spawn’ has on its
parameter.  The documentation shows us the following:

pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>
    where
        F: FnOnce() -> T,
        F: Send + 'static,
        T: Send + 'static,

The ‘F’ type parameter is the one we're concerned with here; the ‘T’
type parameter is related to the return value, and we're not concerned
with that.  We can see that ‘spawn’ uses ‘FnOnce’ as the trait bound on
‘F’.  This is probably what we want as well, because we'll eventually
pass the argument we get in ‘execute’ to ‘spawn’.  We can be further
confident that ‘FnOnce’ is the trait we want to use because the thread
for running a request will only execute that request's closure one time,
which matches the ‘Once’ in ‘FnOnce’.

The ‘F’ type parameter also has the trait bound ‘Send’ and the lifetime
bound ‘'static’, which are useful in our situation: we need ‘Send’ to
transfer the closure from one thread to another and ‘'static’ because we
don't know how long the thread will take to execute.  Let's create an
‘execute’ method on ‘ThreadPool’ that will take a generic parameter of
type ‘F’ with these bounds:

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
    }
}

We still use the ‘()’ after ‘FnOnce’ because this ‘FnOnce’ represents a
closure that takes no parameters and returns the unit type ‘()’.  Just
like function definitions, the return type can be omitted from the
signature, but even if we have no parameters, we still need the
parentheses.

Again, this is the simplest implementation of the ‘execute’ method: it
does nothing, but we're trying only to make our code compile.  Let's
check it again:

$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.24s

It compiles!  But note that if you try ‘cargo run’ and make a request in
the browser, you'll see the errors in the browser that we saw at the
beginning of the chapter.  Our library isn't actually calling the
closure passed to ‘execute’ yet!

Note: A saying you might hear about languages with strict compilers,
such as Haskell and Rust, is “if the code compiles, it works.” But this
saying is not universally true.  Our project compiles, but it does
absolutely nothing!  If we were building a real, complete project, this
would be a good time to start writing unit tests to check that the code
compiles ‘and’ has the behavior we want.

Consider: what would be different here if we were going to execute a
‘future’ instead of a closure?  Validating the Number of Threads in
‘new’ We aren't doing anything with the parameters to ‘new’ and
‘execute’.  Let's implement the bodies of these functions with the
behavior we want.  To start, let's think about ‘new’.  Earlier we chose
an unsigned type for the ‘size’ parameter, because a pool with a
negative number of threads makes no sense.  However, a pool with zero
threads also makes no sense, yet zero is a perfectly valid ‘usize’.
We'll add code to check that ‘size’ is greater than zero before we
return a ‘ThreadPool’ instance and have the program panic if it receives
a zero by using the ‘assert!’ macro, as shown in Listing 21-13.

impl ThreadPool {
    /// Create a new ThreadPool.
    ///
    /// The size is the number of threads in the pool.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// The `new` function will panic if the size is zero.
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);

        ThreadPool
    }

    // --snip--
}

We've also added some documentation for our ‘ThreadPool’ with doc
comments.  Note that we followed good documentation practices by adding
a section that calls out the situations in which our function can panic,
as discussed in Chapter 14.  Try running ‘cargo doc --open’ and clicking
the ‘ThreadPool’ struct to see what the generated docs for ‘new’ look
like!

Instead of adding the ‘assert!’ macro as we've done here, we could
change ‘new’ into ‘build’ and return a ‘Result’ like we did with
‘Config::build’ in the I/O project in Listing 12-9.  But we've decided
in this case that trying to create a thread pool without any threads
should be an unrecoverable error.  If you're feeling ambitious, try to
write a function named ‘build’ with the following signature to compare
with the ‘new’ function:

pub fn build(size: usize) -> Result<ThreadPool, PoolCreationError> {

Creating Space to Store the Threads Now that we have a way to know we
have a valid number of threads to store in the pool, we can create those
threads and store them in the ‘ThreadPool’ struct before returning the
struct.  But how do we “store” a thread?  Let's take another look at the
‘thread::spawn’ signature:

pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>
    where
        F: FnOnce() -> T,
        F: Send + 'static,
        T: Send + 'static,

The ‘spawn’ function returns a ‘JoinHandle<T>’, where ‘T’ is the type
that the closure returns.  Let's try using ‘JoinHandle’ too and see what
happens.  In our case, the closures we're passing to the thread pool
will handle the connection and not return anything, so ‘T’ will be the
unit type ‘()’.

The code in Listing 21-14 will compile but doesn't create any threads
yet.  We've changed the definition of ‘ThreadPool’ to hold a vector of
‘thread::JoinHandle<()>’ instances, initialized the vector with a
capacity of ‘size’, set up a ‘for’ loop that will run some code to
create the threads, and returned a ‘ThreadPool’ instance containing
them.

use std::thread;

pub struct ThreadPool {
    threads: Vec<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,
}

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);

        let mut threads = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for _ in 0..size {
            // create some threads and store them in the vector
        }

        ThreadPool { threads }
    }
    // --snip--
}

We've brought ‘std::thread’ into scope in the library crate, because
we're using ‘thread::JoinHandle’ as the type of the items in the vector
in ‘ThreadPool’.

Once a valid size is received, our ‘ThreadPool’ creates a new vector
that can hold ‘size’ items.  The ‘with_capacity’ function performs the
same task as ‘Vec::new’ but with an important difference: it
preallocates space in the vector.  Because we know we need to store
‘size’ elements in the vector, doing this allocation up front is
slightly more efficient than using ‘Vec::new’, which resizes itself as
elements are inserted.

When you run ‘cargo check’ again, it should succeed.  A ‘Worker’ Struct
Responsible for Sending Code from the ‘ThreadPool’ to a Thread We left a
comment in the ‘for’ loop in Listing 21-14 regarding the creation of
threads.  Here, we'll look at how we actually create threads.  The
standard library provides ‘thread::spawn’ as a way to create threads,
and ‘thread::spawn’ expects to get some code the thread should run as
soon as the thread is created.  However, in our case, we want to create
the threads and have them ‘wait’ for code that we'll send later.  The
standard library's implementation of threads doesn't include any way to
do that; we have to implement it manually.

We'll implement this behavior by introducing a new data structure
between the ‘ThreadPool’ and the threads that will manage this new
behavior.  We'll call this data structure ‘Worker’, which is a common
term in pooling implementations.  The Worker picks up code that needs to
be run and runs the code in the Worker's thread.  Think of people
working in the kitchen at a restaurant: the workers wait until orders
come in from customers, and then they're responsible for taking those
orders and fulfilling them.

Instead of storing a vector of ‘JoinHandle<()>’ instances in the thread
pool, we'll store instances of the ‘Worker’ struct.  Each ‘Worker’ will
store a single ‘JoinHandle<()>’ instance.  Then we'll implement a method
on ‘Worker’ that will take a closure of code to run and send it to the
already running thread for execution.  We'll also give each worker an
‘id’ so we can distinguish between the different workers in the pool
when logging or debugging.

Here is the new process that will happen when we create a ‘ThreadPool’.
We'll implement the code that sends the closure to the thread after we
have ‘Worker’ set up in this way:

  1. Define a ‘Worker’ struct that holds an ‘id’ and a ‘JoinHandle<()>’.
  2. Change ‘ThreadPool’ to hold a vector of ‘Worker’ instances.
  3. Define a ‘Worker::new’ function that takes an ‘id’ number and
     returns a ‘Worker’ instance that holds the ‘id’ and a thread
     spawned with an empty closure.
  4. In ‘ThreadPool::new’, use the ‘for’ loop counter to generate an
     ‘id’, create a new ‘Worker’ with that ‘id’, and store the worker in
     the vector.

If you're up for a challenge, try implementing these changes on your own
before looking at the code in Listing 21-15.

Ready?  Here is Listing 21-15 with one way to make the preceding
modifications.

use std::thread;

pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
}

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);

        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for id in 0..size {
            workers.push(Worker::new(id));
        }

        ThreadPool { workers }
    }
    // --snip--
}

struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    thread: thread::JoinHandle<()>,
}

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(|| {});

        Worker { id, thread }
    }
}

We've changed the name of the field on ‘ThreadPool’ from ‘threads’ to
‘workers’ because it's now holding ‘Worker’ instances instead of
‘JoinHandle<()>’ instances.  We use the counter in the ‘for’ loop as an
argument to ‘Worker::new’, and we store each new ‘Worker’ in the vector
named ‘workers’.

External code (like our server in ‘src/main.rs’) doesn't need to know
the implementation details regarding using a ‘Worker’ struct within
‘ThreadPool’, so we make the ‘Worker’ struct and its ‘new’ function
private.  The ‘Worker::new’ function uses the ‘id’ we give it and stores
a ‘JoinHandle<()>’ instance that is created by spawning a new thread
using an empty closure.

Note: If the operating system can't create a thread because there aren't
enough system resources, ‘thread::spawn’ will panic.  That will cause
our whole server to panic, even though the creation of some threads
might succeed.  For simplicity's sake, this behavior is fine, but in a
production thread pool implementation, you'd likely want to use
‘stdthreadBuilder’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/thread/struct.Builder.html) and
its ‘spawn’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/thread/struct.Builder.html)
method that returns ‘Result’ instead.

This code will compile and will store the number of ‘Worker’ instances
we specified as an argument to ‘ThreadPool::new’.  But we're ‘still’ not
processing the closure that we get in ‘execute’.  Let's look at how to
do that next.  Sending Requests to Threads via Channels The next problem
we'll tackle is that the closures given to ‘thread::spawn’ do absolutely
nothing.  Currently, we get the closure we want to execute in the
‘execute’ method.  But we need to give ‘thread::spawn’ a closure to run
when we create each ‘Worker’ during the creation of the ‘ThreadPool’.

We want the ‘Worker’ structs that we just created to fetch the code to
run from a queue held in the ‘ThreadPool’ and send that code to its
thread to run.

The channels we learned about in Chapter 16--a simple way to communicate
between two threads--would be perfect for this use case.  We'll use a
channel to function as the queue of jobs, and ‘execute’ will send a job
from the ‘ThreadPool’ to the ‘Worker’ instances, which will send the job
to its thread.  Here is the plan:

  1. The ‘ThreadPool’ will create a channel and hold on to the sender.
  2. Each ‘Worker’ will hold on to the receiver.
  3. We'll create a new ‘Job’ struct that will hold the closures we want
     to send down the channel.
  4. The ‘execute’ method will send the job it wants to execute through
     the sender.
  5. In its thread, the ‘Worker’ will loop over its receiver and execute
     the closures of any jobs it receives.

Let's start by creating a channel in ‘ThreadPool::new’ and holding the
sender in the ‘ThreadPool’ instance, as shown in Listing 21-16.  The
‘Job’ struct doesn't hold anything for now but will be the type of item
we're sending down the channel.

use std::{sync::mpsc, thread};

pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    sender: mpsc::Sender<Job>,
}

struct Job;

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);

        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();

        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for id in 0..size {
            workers.push(Worker::new(id));
        }

        ThreadPool { workers, sender }
    }
    // --snip--
}

In ‘ThreadPool::new’, we create our new channel and have the pool hold
the sender.  This will successfully compile.

Let's try passing a receiver of the channel into each worker as the
thread pool creates the channel.  We know we want to use the receiver in
the thread that the workers spawn, so we'll reference the ‘receiver’
parameter in the closure.  The code in Listing 21-17 won't quite compile
yet.

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);

        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();

        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for id in 0..size {
            workers.push(Worker::new(id, receiver));
        }

        ThreadPool { workers, sender }
    }
    // --snip--
}

// --snip--

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: mpsc::Receiver<Job>) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(|| {
            receiver;
        });

        Worker { id, thread }
    }
}

We've made some small and straightforward changes: we pass the receiver
into ‘Worker::new’, and then we use it inside the closure.

When we try to check this code, we get this error:

The code is trying to pass ‘receiver’ to multiple ‘Worker’ instances.
This won't work, as you'll recall from Chapter 16: the channel
implementation that Rust provides is multiple ‘producer’, single
‘consumer’.  This means we can't just clone the consuming end of the
channel to fix this code.  We also don't want to send a message multiple
times to multiple consumers; we want one list of messages with multiple
workers such that each message gets processed once.

Additionally, taking a job off the channel queue involves mutating the
‘receiver’, so the threads need a safe way to share and modify
‘receiver’; otherwise, we might get race conditions (as covered in
Chapter 16).

Recall the thread-safe smart pointers discussed in Chapter 16: to share
ownership across multiple threads and allow the threads to mutate the
value, we need to use ‘Arc<Mutex<T>>’.  The ‘Arc’ type will let multiple
workers own the receiver, and ‘Mutex’ will ensure that only one worker
gets a job from the receiver at a time.  Listing 21-18 shows the changes
we need to make.

use std::{
    sync::{mpsc, Arc, Mutex},
    thread,
};
// --snip--

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);

        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();

        let receiver = Arc::new(Mutex::new(receiver));

        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for id in 0..size {
            workers.push(Worker::new(id, Arc::clone(&receiver)));
        }

        ThreadPool { workers, sender }
    }

    // --snip--
}

// --snip--

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        // --snip--
    }
}

In ‘ThreadPool::new’, we put the receiver in an ‘Arc’ and a ‘Mutex’.
For each new worker, we clone the ‘Arc’ to bump the reference count so
the workers can share ownership of the receiver.

With these changes, the code compiles!  We're getting there!
Implementing the ‘execute’ Method Let's finally implement the ‘execute’
method on ‘ThreadPool’.  We'll also change ‘Job’ from a struct to a type
alias for a trait object that holds the type of closure that ‘execute’
receives.  As discussed in the *note “Creating Type Synonyms with Type
Aliases”: Creating Type Synonyms with Type Aliases. section of Chapter
20, type aliases allow us to make long types shorter for ease of use.
Look at Listing 21-19.

// --snip--

type Job = Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>;

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--

    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
        let job = Box::new(f);

        self.sender.send(job).unwrap();
    }
}

// --snip--

After creating a new ‘Job’ instance using the closure we get in
‘execute’, we send that job down the sending end of the channel.  We're
calling ‘unwrap’ on ‘send’ for the case that sending fails.  This might
happen if, for example, we stop all our threads from executing, meaning
the receiving end has stopped receiving new messages.  At the moment, we
can't stop our threads from executing: our threads continue executing as
long as the pool exists.  The reason we use ‘unwrap’ is that we know the
failure case won't happen, but the compiler doesn't know that.

But we're not quite done yet!  In the worker, our closure being passed
to ‘thread::spawn’ still only ‘references’ the receiving end of the
channel.  Instead, we need the closure to loop forever, asking the
receiving end of the channel for a job and running the job when it gets
one.  Let's make the change shown in Listing 21-20 to ‘Worker::new’.

// --snip--

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(move || loop {
            let job = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();

            println!("Worker {id} got a job; executing.");

            job();
        });

        Worker { id, thread }
    }
}

Here, we first call ‘lock’ on the ‘receiver’ to acquire the mutex, and
then we call ‘unwrap’ to panic on any errors.  Acquiring a lock might
fail if the mutex is in a ‘poisoned’ state, which can happen if some
other thread panicked while holding the lock rather than releasing the
lock.  In this situation, calling ‘unwrap’ to have this thread panic is
the correct action to take.  Feel free to change this ‘unwrap’ to an
‘expect’ with an error message that is meaningful to you.

If we get the lock on the mutex, we call ‘recv’ to receive a ‘Job’ from
the channel.  A final ‘unwrap’ moves past any errors here as well, which
might occur if the thread holding the sender has shut down, similar to
how the ‘send’ method returns ‘Err’ if the receiver shuts down.

The call to ‘recv’ blocks, so if there is no job yet, the current thread
will wait until a job becomes available.  The ‘Mutex<T>’ ensures that
only one ‘Worker’ thread at a time is trying to request a job.

Our thread pool is now in a working state!  Give it a ‘cargo run’ and
make some requests:

Success!  We now have a thread pool that executes connections
asynchronously.  There are never more than four threads created, so our
system won't get overloaded if the server receives a lot of requests.
If we make a request to ‘/sleep’, the server will be able to serve other
requests by having another thread run them.

Note: If you open ‘/sleep’ in multiple browser windows simultaneously,
they might load one at a time in 5 second intervals.  Some web browsers
execute multiple instances of the same request sequentially for caching
reasons.  This limitation is not caused by our web server.

This is a good time to pause and consider how the code in Listings
21-18, 21-19, and 21-20 would be different if we were using futures
instead of a closure for the work to be done.  What types would change?
How would the method signatures be different, if at all?  What parts of
the code would stay the same?

After learning about the ‘while let’ loop in Chapters 17 and 18, you
might be wondering why we didn't write the worker thread code as shown
in Listing 21-21.

// --snip--

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(move || {
            while let Ok(job) = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv() {
                println!("Worker {id} got a job; executing.");

                job();
            }
        });

        Worker { id, thread }
    }
}

This code compiles and runs but doesn't result in the desired threading
behavior: a slow request will still cause other requests to wait to be
processed.  The reason is somewhat subtle: the ‘Mutex’ struct has no
public ‘unlock’ method because the ownership of the lock is based on the
lifetime of the ‘MutexGuard<T>’ within the ‘LockResult<MutexGuard<T>>’
that the ‘lock’ method returns.  At compile time, the borrow checker can
then enforce the rule that a resource guarded by a ‘Mutex’ cannot be
accessed unless we hold the lock.  However, this implementation can also
result in the lock being held longer than intended if we aren't mindful
of the lifetime of the ‘MutexGuard<T>’.

The code in Listing 21-20 that uses ‘let job =
receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();’ works because with ‘let’, any
temporary values used in the expression on the right hand side of the
equals sign are immediately dropped when the ‘let’ statement ends.
However, ‘while let’ (and ‘if let’ and ‘match’) does not drop temporary
values until the end of the associated block.  In Listing 21-21, the
lock remains held for the duration of the call to ‘job()’, meaning other
workers cannot receive jobs.

23.1.3 Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup
------------------------------------

The code in Listing 21-20 is responding to requests asynchronously
through the use of a thread pool, as we intended.  We get some warnings
about the ‘workers’, ‘id’, and ‘thread’ fields that we're not using in a
direct way that reminds us we're not cleaning up anything.  When we use
the less elegant ctrl-c method to halt the main thread, all other
threads are stopped immediately as well, even if they're in the middle
of serving a request.

Next, then, we'll implement the ‘Drop’ trait to call ‘join’ on each of
the threads in the pool so they can finish the requests they're working
on before closing.  Then we'll implement a way to tell the threads they
should stop accepting new requests and shut down.  To see this code in
action, we'll modify our server to accept only two requests before
gracefully shutting down its thread pool.

One thing to notice as we go: none of this affects the parts of the code
that handle executing the closures, so everything here would be just the
same if we were using a thread pool for an async runtime.

23.1.3.1 Implementing the ‘Drop’ Trait on ‘ThreadPool’
......................................................

Let's start with implementing ‘Drop’ on our thread pool.  When the pool
is dropped, our threads should all join to make sure they finish their
work.  Listing 21-22 shows a first attempt at a ‘Drop’ implementation;
this code won't quite work yet.

impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);

            worker.thread.join().unwrap();
        }
    }
}

First, we loop through each of the thread pool ‘workers’.  We use ‘&mut’
for this because ‘self’ is a mutable reference, and we also need to be
able to mutate ‘worker’.  For each worker, we print a message saying
that this particular worker is shutting down, and then we call ‘join’ on
that worker's thread.  If the call to ‘join’ fails, we use ‘unwrap’ to
make Rust panic and go into an ungraceful shutdown.

Here is the error we get when we compile this code:

$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)

     |             |

error: could not compile `hello` (lib) due to 1 previous error

The error tells us we can't call ‘join’ because we only have a mutable
borrow of each ‘worker’ and ‘join’ takes ownership of its argument.  To
solve this issue, we need to move the thread out of the ‘Worker’
instance that owns ‘thread’ so ‘join’ can consume the thread.  We did
this in Listing 17-15: if ‘Worker’ holds an
‘Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>’ instead, we can call the ‘take’ method
on the ‘Option’ to move the value out of the ‘Some’ variant and leave a
‘None’ variant in its place.  In other words, a ‘Worker’ that is running
will have a ‘Some’ variant in ‘thread’, and when we want to clean up a
‘Worker’, we'll replace ‘Some’ with ‘None’ so the ‘Worker’ doesn't have
a thread to run.

So we know we want to update the definition of ‘Worker’ like this:

struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    thread: Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,
}

Now let's lean on the compiler to find the other places that need to
change.  Checking this code, we get two errors:

$ cargo check

error: could not compile `hello` (lib) due to 2 previous errors

Let's address the second error, which points to the code at the end of
‘Worker::new’; we need to wrap the ‘thread’ value in ‘Some’ when we
create a new ‘Worker’.  Make the following changes to fix this error:

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        // --snip--

        Worker {
            id,
            thread: Some(thread),
        }
    }
}

The first error is in our ‘Drop’ implementation.  We mentioned earlier
that we intended to call ‘take’ on the ‘Option’ value to move ‘thread’
out of ‘worker’.  The following changes will do so:

impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);

            if let Some(thread) = worker.thread.take() {
                thread.join().unwrap();
            }
        }
    }
}

As discussed in Chapter 18, the ‘take’ method on ‘Option’ takes the
‘Some’ variant out and leaves ‘None’ in its place.  We're using ‘if let’
to destructure the ‘Some’ and get the thread; then we call ‘join’ on the
thread.  If a worker's thread is already ‘None’, we know that worker has
already had its thread cleaned up, so nothing happens in that case.

23.1.3.2 Signaling to the Threads to Stop Listening for Jobs
............................................................

With all the changes we've made, our code compiles without any warnings.
However, the bad news is this code doesn't function the way we want it
to yet.  The key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the
‘Worker’ instances: at the moment, we call ‘join’, but that won't shut
down the threads because they ‘loop’ forever looking for jobs.  If we
try to drop our ‘ThreadPool’ with our current implementation of ‘drop’,
the main thread will block forever waiting for the first thread to
finish.

To fix this problem, we'll need a change in the ‘ThreadPool’ ‘drop’
implementation and then a change in the ‘Worker’ loop.

First, we'll change the ‘ThreadPool’ ‘drop’ implementation to explicitly
drop the ‘sender’ before waiting for the threads to finish.  Listing
21-23 shows the changes to ‘ThreadPool’ to explicitly drop ‘sender’.  We
use the same ‘Option’ and ‘take’ technique as we did with the thread to
be able to move ‘sender’ out of ‘ThreadPool’:

pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    sender: Option<mpsc::Sender<Job>>,
}
// --snip--
impl ThreadPool {
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        // --snip--

        ThreadPool {
            workers,
            sender: Some(sender),
        }
    }

    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
        let job = Box::new(f);

        self.sender.as_ref().unwrap().send(job).unwrap();
    }
}

impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        drop(self.sender.take());

        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);

            if let Some(thread) = worker.thread.take() {
                thread.join().unwrap();
            }
        }
    }
}

Dropping ‘sender’ closes the channel, which indicates no more messages
will be sent.  When that happens, all the calls to ‘recv’ that the
workers do in the infinite loop will return an error.  In Listing 21-24,
we change the ‘Worker’ loop to gracefully exit the loop in that case,
which means the threads will finish when the ‘ThreadPool’ ‘drop’
implementation calls ‘join’ on them.

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(move || loop {
            let message = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv();

            match message {
                Ok(job) => {
                    println!("Worker {id} got a job; executing.");

                    job();
                }
                Err(_) => {
                    println!("Worker {id} disconnected; shutting down.");
                    break;
                }
            }
        });

        Worker {
            id,
            thread: Some(thread),
        }
    }
}

To see this code in action, let's modify ‘main’ to accept only two
requests before gracefully shutting down the server, as shown in Listing
21-25.

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();
    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);

    for stream in listener.incoming().take(2) {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        pool.execute(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }

    println!("Shutting down.");
}

You wouldn't want a real-world web server to shut down after serving
only two requests.  This code just demonstrates that the graceful
shutdown and cleanup is in working order.

The ‘take’ method is defined in the ‘Iterator’ trait and limits the
iteration to the first two items at most.  The ‘ThreadPool’ will go out
of scope at the end of ‘main’, and the ‘drop’ implementation will run.

Start the server with ‘cargo run’, and make three requests.  The third
request should error, and in your terminal you should see output similar
to this:

$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.41s
     Running `target/debug/hello`
Worker 0 got a job; executing.
Shutting down.
Shutting down worker 0
Worker 3 got a job; executing.
Worker 1 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 2 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 3 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 0 disconnected; shutting down.
Shutting down worker 1
Shutting down worker 2
Shutting down worker 3

You might see a different ordering of workers and messages printed.  We
can see how this code works from the messages: workers 0 and 3 got the
first two requests.  The server stopped accepting connections after the
second connection, and the ‘Drop’ implementation on ‘ThreadPool’ starts
executing before worker 3 even starts its job.  Dropping the ‘sender’
disconnects all the workers and tells them to shut down.  The workers
each print a message when they disconnect, and then the thread pool
calls ‘join’ to wait for each worker thread to finish.

Notice one interesting aspect of this particular execution: the
‘ThreadPool’ dropped the ‘sender’, and before any worker received an
error, we tried to join worker 0.  Worker 0 had not yet gotten an error
from ‘recv’, so the main thread blocked waiting for worker 0 to finish.
In the meantime, worker 3 received a job and then all threads received
an error.  When worker 0 finished, the main thread waited for the rest
of the workers to finish.  At that point, they had all exited their
loops and stopped.

Congrats!  We've now completed our project; we have a basic web server
that uses a thread pool to respond asynchronously.  We're able to
perform a graceful shutdown of the server, which cleans up all the
threads in the pool.

Here's the full code for reference:

    fs,

    for stream in listener.incoming().take(2) {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        pool.execute(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }

    println!("Shutting down.");
}

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
    let request_line = buf_reader.lines().next().unwrap().unwrap();

    let (status_line, filename) = match &request_line[..] {
        "GET / HTTP/1.1" => ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", "hello.html"),
        "GET /sleep HTTP/1.1" => {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));

            match message {
                Ok(job) => {
                    println!("Worker {id} got a job; executing.");

        Worker {
            id,
            thread: Some(thread),
        }
    }
}

We could do more here!  If you want to continue enhancing this project,
here are some ideas:

   • Add more documentation to ‘ThreadPool’ and its public methods.
   • Add tests of the library's functionality.
   • Change calls to ‘unwrap’ to more robust error handling.
   • Use ‘ThreadPool’ to perform some task other than serving web
     requests.
   • Find a thread pool crate on cratesio (https://crates.io/) and
     implement a similar web server using the crate instead.  Then
     compare its API and robustness to the thread pool we implemented.

24.1.1.2 Raw Identifiers
........................

‘Raw identifiers’ are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they
wouldn't normally be allowed.  You use a raw identifier by prefixing a
keyword with ‘r#’.

For example, ‘match’ is a keyword.  If you try to compile the following
function that uses ‘match’ as its name:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}

you'll get this error:

error: expected identifier, found keyword `match`
 --> src/main.rs:4:4
  |
4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {
  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword

The error shows that you can't use the keyword ‘match’ as the function
identifier.  To use ‘match’ as a function name, you need to use the raw
identifier syntax, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn r#match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}

fn main() {
    assert!(r#match("foo", "foobar"));
}

This code will compile without any errors.  Note the ‘r#’ prefix on the
function name in its definition as well as where the function is called
in ‘main’.

Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier,
even if that word happens to be a reserved keyword.  This gives us more
freedom to choose identifier names, as well as lets us integrate with
programs written in a language where these words aren't keywords.  In
addition, raw identifiers allow you to use libraries written in a
different Rust edition than your crate uses.  For example, ‘try’ isn't a
keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018 edition.  If you depend
on a library that's written using the 2015 edition and has a ‘try’
function, you'll need to use the raw identifier syntax, ‘r#try’ in this
case, to call that function from your 2018 edition code.  See *note
Appendix E: Appendix E - Editions. for more information on editions.

24.1.2.1 Operators
..................

Table B-1 contains the operators in Rust, an example of how the operator
would appear in context, a short explanation, and whether that operator
is overloadable.  If an operator is overloadable, the relevant trait to
use to overload that operator is listed.

24.1.3 Appendix C: Derivable Traits
-----------------------------------

In various places in the book, we've discussed the ‘derive’ attribute,
which you can apply to a struct or enum definition.  The ‘derive’
attribute generates code that will implement a trait with its own
default implementation on the type you've annotated with the ‘derive’
syntax.

In this appendix, we provide a reference of all the traits in the
standard library that you can use with ‘derive’.  Each section covers:

   • What operators and methods deriving this trait will enable
   • What the implementation of the trait provided by ‘derive’ does
   • What implementing the trait signifies about the type
   • The conditions in which you're allowed or not allowed to implement
     the trait
   • Examples of operations that require the trait

If you want different behavior from that provided by the ‘derive’
attribute, consult the standard library documentation
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/../std/index.html) for each trait for
details of how to manually implement them.

These traits listed here are the only ones defined by the standard
library that can be implemented on your types using ‘derive’.  Other
traits defined in the standard library don't have sensible default
behavior, so it's up to you to implement them in the way that makes
sense for what you're trying to accomplish.

An example of a trait that can't be derived is ‘Display’, which handles
formatting for end users.  You should always consider the appropriate
way to display a type to an end user.  What parts of the type should an
end user be allowed to see?  What parts would they find relevant?  What
format of the data would be most relevant to them?  The Rust compiler
doesn't have this insight, so it can't provide appropriate default
behavior for you.

The list of derivable traits provided in this appendix is not
comprehensive: libraries can implement ‘derive’ for their own traits,
making the list of traits you can use ‘derive’ with truly open-ended.
Implementing ‘derive’ involves using a procedural macro, which is
covered in the *note “Macros”: Macros. section of Chapter 20.

24.1.3.1 ‘Debug’ for Programmer Output
......................................

The ‘Debug’ trait enables debug formatting in format strings, which you
indicate by adding ‘:?’ within ‘{}’ placeholders.

The ‘Debug’ trait allows you to print instances of a type for debugging
purposes, so you and other programmers using your type can inspect an
instance at a particular point in a program's execution.

The ‘Debug’ trait is required, for example, in using the ‘assert_eq!’
macro.  This macro prints the values of instances given as arguments if
the equality assertion fails so programmers can see why the two
instances weren't equal.

24.1.3.2 ‘PartialEq’ and ‘Eq’ for Equality Comparisons
......................................................

The ‘PartialEq’ trait allows you to compare instances of a type to check
for equality and enables use of the ‘==’ and ‘!=’ operators.

Deriving ‘PartialEq’ implements the ‘eq’ method.  When ‘PartialEq’ is
derived on structs, two instances are equal only if ‘all’ fields are
equal, and the instances are not equal if any fields are not equal.
When derived on enums, each variant is equal to itself and not equal to
the other variants.

The ‘PartialEq’ trait is required, for example, with the use of the
‘assert_eq!’ macro, which needs to be able to compare two instances of a
type for equality.

The ‘Eq’ trait has no methods.  Its purpose is to signal that for every
value of the annotated type, the value is equal to itself.  The ‘Eq’
trait can only be applied to types that also implement ‘PartialEq’,
although not all types that implement ‘PartialEq’ can implement ‘Eq’.
One example of this is floating point number types: the implementation
of floating point numbers states that two instances of the not-a-number
(‘NaN’) value are not equal to each other.

An example of when ‘Eq’ is required is for keys in a ‘HashMap<K, V>’ so
the ‘HashMap<K, V>’ can tell whether two keys are the same.

24.1.3.3 ‘PartialOrd’ and ‘Ord’ for Ordering Comparisons
........................................................

The ‘PartialOrd’ trait allows you to compare instances of a type for
sorting purposes.  A type that implements ‘PartialOrd’ can be used with
the ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘<=’, and ‘>=’ operators.  You can only apply the
‘PartialOrd’ trait to types that also implement ‘PartialEq’.

Deriving ‘PartialOrd’ implements the ‘partial_cmp’ method, which returns
an ‘Option<Ordering>’ that will be ‘None’ when the values given don't
produce an ordering.  An example of a value that doesn't produce an
ordering, even though most values of that type can be compared, is the
not-a-number (‘NaN’) floating point value.  Calling ‘partial_cmp’ with
any floating point number and the ‘NaN’ floating point value will return
‘None’.

When derived on structs, ‘PartialOrd’ compares two instances by
comparing the value in each field in the order in which the fields
appear in the struct definition.  When derived on enums, variants of the
enum declared earlier in the enum definition are considered less than
the variants listed later.

The ‘PartialOrd’ trait is required, for example, for the ‘gen_range’
method from the ‘rand’ crate that generates a random value in the range
specified by a range expression.

The ‘Ord’ trait allows you to know that for any two values of the
annotated type, a valid ordering will exist.  The ‘Ord’ trait implements
the ‘cmp’ method, which returns an ‘Ordering’ rather than an
‘Option<Ordering>’ because a valid ordering will always be possible.
You can only apply the ‘Ord’ trait to types that also implement
‘PartialOrd’ and ‘Eq’ (and ‘Eq’ requires ‘PartialEq’).  When derived on
structs and enums, ‘cmp’ behaves the same way as the derived
implementation for ‘partial_cmp’ does with ‘PartialOrd’.

An example of when ‘Ord’ is required is when storing values in a
‘BTreeSet<T>’, a data structure that stores data based on the sort order
of the values.

24.1.3.4 ‘Clone’ and ‘Copy’ for Duplicating Values
..................................................

The ‘Clone’ trait allows you to explicitly create a deep copy of a
value, and the duplication process might involve running arbitrary code
and copying heap data.  See the *note “Ways Variables and Data Interact
Clone”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch04-01-what-is-ownershipmd__ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone.
section in Chapter 4 for more information on ‘Clone’.

Deriving ‘Clone’ implements the ‘clone’ method, which when implemented
for the whole type, calls ‘clone’ on each of the parts of the type.
This means all the fields or values in the type must also implement
‘Clone’ to derive ‘Clone’.

An example of when ‘Clone’ is required is when calling the ‘to_vec’
method on a slice.  The slice doesn't own the type instances it
contains, but the vector returned from ‘to_vec’ will need to own its
instances, so ‘to_vec’ calls ‘clone’ on each item.  Thus, the type
stored in the slice must implement ‘Clone’.

The ‘Copy’ trait allows you to duplicate a value by only copying bits
stored on the stack; no arbitrary code is necessary.  See the *note
“Stack-Only Data Copy”:
#book__pandoc__texi__src__ch04-01-what-is-ownershipmd__stack-only-data-copy.
section in Chapter 4 for more information on ‘Copy’.

The ‘Copy’ trait doesn't define any methods to prevent programmers from
overloading those methods and violating the assumption that no arbitrary
code is being run.  That way, all programmers can assume that copying a
value will be very fast.

You can derive ‘Copy’ on any type whose parts all implement ‘Copy’.  A
type that implements ‘Copy’ must also implement ‘Clone’, because a type
that implements ‘Copy’ has a trivial implementation of ‘Clone’ that
performs the same task as ‘Copy’.

The ‘Copy’ trait is rarely required; types that implement ‘Copy’ have
optimizations available, meaning you don't have to call ‘clone’, which
makes the code more concise.

Everything possible with ‘Copy’ you can also accomplish with ‘Clone’,
but the code might be slower or have to use ‘clone’ in places.

24.1.3.5 ‘Hash’ for Mapping a Value to a Value of Fixed Size
............................................................

The ‘Hash’ trait allows you to take an instance of a type of arbitrary
size and map that instance to a value of fixed size using a hash
function.  Deriving ‘Hash’ implements the ‘hash’ method.  The derived
implementation of the ‘hash’ method combines the result of calling
‘hash’ on each of the parts of the type, meaning all fields or values
must also implement ‘Hash’ to derive ‘Hash’.

An example of when ‘Hash’ is required is in storing keys in a
‘HashMap<K, V>’ to store data efficiently.

24.1.3.6 ‘Default’ for Default Values
.....................................

The ‘Default’ trait allows you to create a default value for a type.
Deriving ‘Default’ implements the ‘default’ function.  The derived
implementation of the ‘default’ function calls the ‘default’ function on
each part of the type, meaning all fields or values in the type must
also implement ‘Default’ to derive ‘Default’.

The ‘Default::default’ function is commonly used in combination with the
struct update syntax discussed in the *note “Creating Instances From
Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax”: Creating Instances from
Other Instances with Struct Update Syntax. section in Chapter 5.  You
can customize a few fields of a struct and then set and use a default
value for the rest of the fields by using ‘..Default::default()’.

The ‘Default’ trait is required when you use the method
‘unwrap_or_default’ on ‘Option<T>’ instances, for example.  If the
‘Option<T>’ is ‘None’, the method ‘unwrap_or_default’ will return the
result of ‘Default::default’ for the type ‘T’ stored in the ‘Option<T>’.

24.1.4.1 Automatic Formatting with ‘rustfmt’
............................................

The ‘rustfmt’ tool reformats your code according to the community code
style.  Many collaborative projects use ‘rustfmt’ to prevent arguments
about which style to use when writing Rust: everyone formats their code
using the tool.

To install ‘rustfmt’, enter the following:

$ rustup component add rustfmt

This command gives you ‘rustfmt’ and ‘cargo-fmt’, similar to how Rust
gives you both ‘rustc’ and ‘cargo’.  To format any Cargo project, enter
the following:

$ cargo fmt

Running this command reformats all the Rust code in the current crate.
This should only change the code style, not the code semantics.  For
more information on ‘rustfmt’, see its documentation
(https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt).

24.1.4.2 Fix Your Code with ‘rustfix’
.....................................

The rustfix tool is included with Rust installations and can
automatically fix compiler warnings that have a clear way to correct the
problem that's likely what you want.  It's likely you've seen compiler
warnings before.  For example, consider this code:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn do_something() {}

fn main() {
    for i in 0..100 {
        do_something();
    }
}

Here, we're calling the ‘do_something’ function 100 times, but we never
use the variable ‘i’ in the body of the ‘for’ loop.  Rust warns us about
that:

$ cargo build
   Compiling myprogram v0.1.0 (file:///projects/myprogram)
warning: unused variable: `i`
 --> src/main.rs:4:9
  |
4 |     for i in 0..100 {
  |         ^ help: consider using `_i` instead
  |
  = note: #[warn(unused_variables)] on by default

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.50s

The warning suggests that we use ‘_i’ as a name instead: the underscore
indicates that we intend for this variable to be unused.  We can
automatically apply that suggestion using the ‘rustfix’ tool by running
the command ‘cargo fix’:

$ cargo fix
    Checking myprogram v0.1.0 (file:///projects/myprogram)
      Fixing src/main.rs (1 fix)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s

When we look at ‘src/main.rs’ again, we'll see that ‘cargo fix’ has
changed the code:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn do_something() {}

fn main() {
    for _i in 0..100 {
        do_something();
    }
}

The ‘for’ loop variable is now named ‘_i’, and the warning no longer
appears.

You can also use the ‘cargo fix’ command to transition your code between
different Rust editions.  Editions are covered in *note Appendix E:
Appendix E - Editions.

24.1.4.3 More Lints with Clippy
...............................

The Clippy tool is a collection of lints to analyze your code so you can
catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.

To install Clippy, enter the following:

$ rustup component add clippy

To run Clippy's lints on any Cargo project, enter the following:

$ cargo clippy

For example, say you write a program that uses an approximation of a
mathematical constant, such as pi, as this program does:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = 3.1415;
    let r = 8.0;
    println!("the area of the circle is {}", x * r * r);
}

Running ‘cargo clippy’ on this project results in this error:

error: approximate value of `f{32, 64}::consts::PI` found
 --> src/main.rs:2:13
  |
2 |     let x = 3.1415;
  |             ^^^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[deny(clippy::approx_constant)]` on by default
  = help: consider using the constant directly
  = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#approx_constant

This error lets you know that Rust already has a more precise ‘PI’
constant defined, and that your program would be more correct if you
used the constant instead.  You would then change your code to use the
‘PI’ constant.  The following code doesn't result in any errors or
warnings from Clippy:

Filename: src/main.rs

fn main() {
    let x = std::f64::consts::PI;
    let r = 8.0;
    println!("the area of the circle is {}", x * r * r);
}

For more information on Clippy, see its documentation
(https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy).

24.1.4.4 IDE Integration Using ‘rust-analyzer’
..............................................

To help IDE integration, the Rust community recommends using
‘rust-analyzer’ (https://rust-analyzer.github.io).  This tool is a set
of compiler-centric utilities that speaks the Language Server Protocol
(http://langserver.org/), which is a specification for IDEs and
programming languages to communicate with each other.  Different clients
can use ‘rust-analyzer’, such as the Rust analyzer plug-in for Visual
Studio Code
(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

Visit the ‘rust-analyzer’ project's home page
(https://rust-analyzer.github.io) for installation instructions, then
install the language server support in your particular IDE. Your IDE
will gain abilities such as autocompletion, jump to definition, and
inline errors.

24.1.5 Appendix E - Editions
----------------------------

In Chapter 1, you saw that ‘cargo new’ adds a bit of metadata to your
‘Cargo.toml’ file about an edition.  This appendix talks about what that
means!

The Rust language and compiler have a six-week release cycle, meaning
users get a constant stream of new features.  Other programming
languages release larger changes less often; Rust releases smaller
updates more frequently.  After a while, all of these tiny changes add
up.  But from release to release, it can be difficult to look back and
say, “Wow, between Rust 1.10 and Rust 1.31, Rust has changed a lot!”

Every two or three years, the Rust team produces a new Rust ‘edition’.
Each edition brings together the features that have landed into a clear
package with fully updated documentation and tooling.  New editions ship
as part of the usual six-week release process.

Editions serve different purposes for different people:

   • For active Rust users, a new edition brings together incremental
     changes into an easy-to-understand package.
   • For non-users, a new edition signals that some major advancements
     have landed, which might make Rust worth another look.
   • For those developing Rust, a new edition provides a rallying point
     for the project as a whole.

At the time of this writing, three Rust editions are available: Rust
2015, Rust 2018, and Rust 2021.  This book is written using Rust 2021
edition idioms.

The ‘edition’ key in ‘Cargo.toml’ indicates which edition the compiler
should use for your code.  If the key doesn't exist, Rust uses ‘2015’ as
the edition value for backward compatibility reasons.

Each project can opt in to an edition other than the default 2015
edition.  Editions can contain incompatible changes, such as including a
new keyword that conflicts with identifiers in code.  However, unless
you opt in to those changes, your code will continue to compile even as
you upgrade the Rust compiler version you use.

All Rust compiler versions support any edition that existed prior to
that compiler's release, and they can link crates of any supported
editions together.  Edition changes only affect the way the compiler
initially parses code.  Therefore, if you're using Rust 2015 and one of
your dependencies uses Rust 2018, your project will compile and be able
to use that dependency.  The opposite situation, where your project uses
Rust 2018 and a dependency uses Rust 2015, works as well.

To be clear: most features will be available on all editions.
Developers using any Rust edition will continue to see improvements as
new stable releases are made.  However, in some cases, mainly when new
keywords are added, some new features might only be available in later
editions.  You will need to switch editions if you want to take
advantage of such features.

For more details, the ‘Edition Guide’
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/edition-guide/) is a complete book
about editions that enumerates the differences between editions and
explains how to automatically upgrade your code to a new edition via
‘cargo fix’.

24.1.7.1 Stability Without Stagnation
.....................................

As a language, Rust cares a ‘lot’ about the stability of your code.  We
want Rust to be a rock-solid foundation you can build on, and if things
were constantly changing, that would be impossible.  At the same time,
if we can't experiment with new features, we may not find out important
flaws until after their release, when we can no longer change things.

Our solution to this problem is what we call “stability without
stagnation”, and our guiding principle is this: you should never have to
fear upgrading to a new version of stable Rust.  Each upgrade should be
painless, but should also bring you new features, fewer bugs, and faster
compile times.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Choo Choo! Release Channels and Riding the Trains,  Next: Maintenance time,  Prev: Stability Without Stagnation,  Up: Appendix G - How Rust is Made and “Nightly Rust”

24.1.7.2 Choo, Choo! Release Channels and Riding the Trains
...........................................................

Rust development operates on a ‘train schedule’.  That is, all
development is done on the ‘master’ branch of the Rust repository.
Releases follow a software release train model, which has been used by
Cisco IOS and other software projects.  There are three ‘release
channels’ for Rust:

   • Nightly
   • Beta
   • Stable

Most Rust developers primarily use the stable channel, but those who
want to try out experimental new features may use nightly or beta.

Here's an example of how the development and release process works:
let's assume that the Rust team is working on the release of Rust 1.5.
That release happened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with
realistic version numbers.  A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit
lands on the ‘master’ branch.  Each night, a new nightly version of Rust
is produced.  Every day is a release day, and these releases are created
by our release infrastructure automatically.  So as time passes, our
releases look like this, once a night:

nightly: * - - * - - *

Every six weeks, it's time to prepare a new release!  The ‘beta’ branch
of the Rust repository branches off from the ‘master’ branch used by
nightly.  Now, there are two releases:

nightly: * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                *

Most Rust users do not use beta releases actively, but test against beta
in their CI system to help Rust discover possible regressions.  In the
meantime, there's still a nightly release every night:

nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                *

Let's say a regression is found.  Good thing we had some time to test
the beta release before the regression snuck into a stable release!  The
fix is applied to ‘master’, so that nightly is fixed, and then the fix
is backported to the ‘beta’ branch, and a new release of beta is
produced:

nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *

Six weeks after the first beta was created, it's time for a stable
release!  The ‘stable’ branch is produced from the ‘beta’ branch:

nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *
                     |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *
                                       |
stable:                                *

Hooray!  Rust 1.5 is done!  However, we've forgotten one thing: because
the six weeks have gone by, we also need a new beta of the ‘next’
version of Rust, 1.6.  So after ‘stable’ branches off of ‘beta’, the
next version of ‘beta’ branches off of ‘nightly’ again:

nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *
                     |                         |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *       *
                                       |
stable:                                *

This is called the “train model” because every six weeks, a release
“leaves the station”, but still has to take a journey through the beta
channel before it arrives as a stable release.

Rust releases every six weeks, like clockwork.  If you know the date of
one Rust release, you can know the date of the next one: it's six weeks
later.  A nice aspect of having releases scheduled every six weeks is
that the next train is coming soon.  If a feature happens to miss a
particular release, there's no need to worry: another one is happening
in a short time!  This helps reduce pressure to sneak possibly
unpolished features in close to the release deadline.

Thanks to this process, you can always check out the next build of Rust
and verify for yourself that it's easy to upgrade to: if a beta release
doesn't work as expected, you can report it to the team and get it fixed
before the next stable release happens!  Breakage in a beta release is
relatively rare, but ‘rustc’ is still a piece of software, and bugs do
exist.

24.1.7.3 Maintenance time
.........................

The Rust project supports the most recent stable version.  When a new
stable version is released, the old version reaches its end of life
(EOL). This means each version is supported for six weeks.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Unstable Features,  Next: Rustup and the Role of Rust Nightly,  Prev: Maintenance time,  Up: Appendix G - How Rust is Made and “Nightly Rust”

24.1.7.4 Unstable Features
..........................

There's one more catch with this release model: unstable features.  Rust
uses a technique called “feature flags” to determine what features are
enabled in a given release.  If a new feature is under active
development, it lands on ‘master’, and therefore, in nightly, but behind
a ‘feature flag’.  If you, as a user, wish to try out the
work-in-progress feature, you can, but you must be using a nightly
release of Rust and annotate your source code with the appropriate flag
to opt in.

If you're using a beta or stable release of Rust, you can't use any
feature flags.  This is the key that allows us to get practical use with
new features before we declare them stable forever.  Those who wish to
opt into the bleeding edge can do so, and those who want a rock-solid
experience can stick with stable and know that their code won't break.
Stability without stagnation.

This book only contains information about stable features, as
in-progress features are still changing, and surely they'll be different
between when this book was written and when they get enabled in stable
builds.  You can find documentation for nightly-only features online.


File: RustBook.info,  Node: Rustup and the Role of Rust Nightly,  Next: The RFC Process and Teams,  Prev: Unstable Features,  Up: Appendix G - How Rust is Made and “Nightly Rust”

24.1.7.5 Rustup and the Role of Rust Nightly
............................................

Rustup makes it easy to change between different release channels of
Rust, on a global or per-project basis.  By default, you'll have stable
Rust installed.  To install nightly, for example:

$ rustup toolchain install nightly

You can see all of the ‘toolchains’ (releases of Rust and associated
components) you have installed with ‘rustup’ as well.  Here's an example
on one of your authors' Windows computer:

> rustup toolchain list
stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)
beta-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

As you can see, the stable toolchain is the default.  Most Rust users
use stable most of the time.  You might want to use stable most of the
time, but use nightly on a specific project, because you care about a
cutting-edge feature.  To do so, you can use ‘rustup override’ in that
project's directory to set the nightly toolchain as the one ‘rustup’
should use when you're in that directory:

$ cd ~/projects/needs-nightly
$ rustup override set nightly

Now, every time you call ‘rustc’ or ‘cargo’ inside of
‘~/projects/needs-nightly’, ‘rustup’ will make sure that you are using
nightly Rust, rather than your default of stable Rust.  This comes in
handy when you have a lot of Rust projects!


File: RustBook.info,  Node: The RFC Process and Teams,  Prev: Rustup and the Role of Rust Nightly,  Up: Appendix G - How Rust is Made and “Nightly Rust”

24.1.7.6 The RFC Process and Teams
..................................

So how do you learn about these new features?  Rust's development model
follows a ‘Request For Comments (RFC) process’.  If you'd like an
improvement in Rust, you can write up a proposal, called an RFC.

Anyone can write RFCs to improve Rust, and the proposals are reviewed
and discussed by the Rust team, which is comprised of many topic
subteams.  There's a full list of the teams on Rust's website
(https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), which includes teams for each
area of the project: language design, compiler implementation,
infrastructure, documentation, and more.  The appropriate team reads the
proposal and the comments, writes some comments of their own, and
eventually, there's consensus to accept or reject the feature.

If the feature is accepted, an issue is opened on the Rust repository,
and someone can implement it.  The person who implements it very well
may not be the person who proposed the feature in the first place!  When
the implementation is ready, it lands on the ‘master’ branch behind a
feature gate, as we discussed in the *note “Unstable Features”: Unstable
Features. section.

After some time, once Rust developers who use nightly releases have been
able to try out the new feature, team members will discuss the feature,
how it's worked out on nightly, and decide if it should make it into
stable Rust or not.  If the decision is to move forward, the feature
gate is removed, and the feature is now considered stable!  It rides the
trains into a new stable release of Rust.
